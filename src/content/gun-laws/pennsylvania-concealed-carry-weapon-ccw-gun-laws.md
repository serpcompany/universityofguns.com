Pennsylvania: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------------


Pennsylvania is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level by the sheriff’s office or if a resident of a city of the first class, with the chief of police of that city. There is no permit required to purchase firearms and although there is no comprehensive firearms registration, the state police maintain a database of all handgun buyers. Private-party transfers of handguns must be conducted through a licensed dealer or at a county sheriff’s office, and a background check is required. These requirements do not apply to transfers between spouses, parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren. ([source](https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/pennsylvania/))


### Self-Defense


Pennsylvania is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. There is no duty to retreat in your residence or any place where you have a legal right to be if confronted with a deadly weapon or an object that appears to be one. Under the law, the use of force against another person is justifiable if the person who acts in self-defense believes that the use of force is: “immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself [or herself] against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.” ([18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 505](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.005.005.000..HTM))


#### Use of Force for the Protection of Property


The use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary: 


* To prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass upon land or the unlawful carrying away of tangible movable property; or
* To effect an entry or re-entry upon land or to retake tangible movable property.


([18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 506](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-18-pacsa-crimes-and-offenses/pa-csa-sect-18-506.html))


#### Use of Force in Self-Protection or the Protection of Others


The use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself or herself or a third party against the use of unlawful force. Deadly force is only justifiable if an actor believes it is necessary to protect one’s self or a third party against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual assault. ([18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 505](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-18-pacsa-crimes-and-offenses/pa-csa-sect-18-505.html))


Such force is not justified if the actor knows that he or she can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating; except the actor is not obliged to retreat from his or her dwelling or place of work, unless he or she was the initial aggressor or is assailed in the place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be. ([18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 505](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-18-pacsa-crimes-and-offenses/pa-csa-sect-18-505.html))


An actor is presumed to have a reasonable belief that deadly force is immediately necessary to protect himself or herself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat if both of the following conditions exist:


* The person against whom the force is used is in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or has unlawfully and forcefully entered and is present within, a dwelling, residence or occupied vehicle; or
* The person against whom the force is used is or is attempting to unlawfully and forcefully remove another against that other’s will from the dwelling, residence or occupied vehicle.

Pennsylvania: Key State Laws
----------------------------




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Brandishing | Pennsylvania law does not define brandishing. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor. [[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5503](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=55&sctn=3&subsctn=0)] |
| Carrying while under the influence | Pennsylvania state statutes do not address carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs. As a responsibly armed American, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgement, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences. |
| Non-resident permits | Non-residents who possess a current license or permit or similar document to carry a firearm issued by their home state (if a license is provided for by the laws of that state) may apply for a non-resident permit. |
| Concealed carry registry | The Pennsylvania concealed carry registry is not accessible to the public. |
| Driver's license and carry license | Your Pennsylvania driver’s license is linked to your Pennsylvania license to carry firearms. Therefore, a law enforcement officer will be notified immediately that you are a concealed carry license holder if they run your driver’s license. |
| Duty to inform | There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Pennsylvania unless the officer asks. [[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6122](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=61&sctn=22&subsctn=0)] |
| No Weapons signs | Pennsylvania does not recognize "No Weapons" signs. |
| Preemption laws | The authority to regulate firearms is reserved to the state, except local municipalities may regulate the discharge of firearms within the cities boundaries. This has been reinforced by the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas decision against the City of Pittsburgh in Anderson v. City of Pittsburgh. The court found that Pittsburgh's attempt to impose local gun control measures was a clear violation of state preemption law. [[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6120](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=61&sctn=20&subsctn=0)] |
