Maine: Gun Laws Summary
-----------------------


As a shall-issue, permitless carry state, Maine allows for both open and concealed carry without a permit. As long as an individual is at least 21 years old, or at least 18 and active duty or honorably discharged military, and can legally possess a firearm, they are allowed to carry openly or concealed. Maine also issues permits for reciprocity purposes. ([source](https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/maine/))


While there is no permit, background check or firearms registration required to buy a handgun from a private individual, Maine Permits to Carry Concealed Handguns (CCHs) require a state-approved firearms training course. These permits are issued to residents and non-residents who are at least 18 years old. Some areas are off-limits for concealed carry, including schools and courthouses.

### Self-Defense


Maine is a Castle Doctrine state, which means that an individual has no duty to retreat inside their dwelling place. ([source](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec104.html))


#### Physical Force in Defense of a Person


Maine law states that a person is justified in using a reasonable degree of non-deadly force upon another person in order to defend themselves or a third party from what they reasonably believe to be the imminent use of unlawful, non-deadly force by such other person. ([source](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec104.html))


Deadly force is justified when a person reasonably believes it necessary and reasonably believes that the other person is about to use unlawful, deadly force against them or a third party, or committing or about to commit a kidnapping, robbery, or sexual assault against them or a third party. ([source](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec108.html))


#### Use of Force in Defense of Premises


A person who is in possession or control of premises or is licensed or privileged to be there is justified in using non-deadly force upon another person when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission of a criminal trespass by such other person in or upon such premises. Deadly force is justified when the person reasonably believes that such other person has entered or is attempting to enter a dwelling place without a license or privilege to do so and is committing or is likely to commit some other crime within the dwelling place.
