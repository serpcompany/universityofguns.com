Wyoming: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Wyoming is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits. The application process is handled by the county sheriff's office and issued by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation. Open carry is legal without a permit for those who are 18 years or older and legally allowed to carry a firearm. As of July 1, 2021, permitless concealed carry is legal for any legal resident of the U.S. who is 21 years old or older and able to possess a firearm. 


### Self-Defense


Wyoming is a Castle Doctrine state and has a "stand your ground" law. The use of defensive force is reasonable when it is necessary to prevent an injury or loss and no more, including deadly force if necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury. A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury to themselves or others when using defensive force, including deadly force.


#### Criminal Immunity


A person who uses legal, reasonable defensive force shall not be criminally prosecuted for that use of reasonable defensive force. ([Wyo. Stat. § 6-8-104(g)](https://codes.findlaw.com/wy/title-6-crimes-and-offenses/wy-st-sect-6-8-104.html))


#### Reciprocity


Wyoming honors permits from other states that recognize Wyoming permits.
