## New Mexico: Gun Laws Summary

New Mexico is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, which are issued by the Department of Public Safety at the state level. As of July 1, 2019, background checks are required for private sales of firearms under SB-8. Exceptions to this law include sales between law enforcement officers or immediate family members. Open carry is legal in New Mexico without a license for individuals who are at least 19 years old and can legally possess a firearm. A New Mexico Concealed Handgun License (CHL) is required for residents and a permit from a state that New Mexico honors is required for non-residents to carry a concealed loaded firearm on foot.

### Self-Defense

New Mexico law allows for justifiable homicide in cases of necessary defense of life, family, a third party, or property. It is also justifiable when committed in the lawful defense of oneself or another when there is reasonable ground to believe a design exists to commit a felony or to do some great personal injury and there is imminent danger. A defendant who kills another in self-defense while standing their ground must show that they were placed in reasonable fear of immediate death or great bodily harm, used reasonable force to avoid the threat, and did not instigate the encounter.

#### Castle Doctrine

Although there is no specific statute establishing the Castle Doctrine, a 1946 state supreme court ruling in State v. Couch stated that "a person who is threatened with an attack need not retreat. In the exercise of their right of self-defense, they may stand their ground and defend themselves." [N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-2-7]

#### Stand Your Ground

New Mexico law allows a person to stand their ground and defend themselves in the necessary defense of their life, family, a third party, or property. [N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-2-7]
