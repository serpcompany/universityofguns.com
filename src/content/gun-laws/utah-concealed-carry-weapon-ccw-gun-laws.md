Utah: Gun Laws Summary
----------------------


Utah is a shall-issue state, and permits are issued by the Bureau of Criminal Identification. As of May 5, 2021, both open carry and concealed carry of a loaded firearm are legal for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a firearm. Utah Concealed Firearm Permits (CFP) are still offered for individuals interested in reciprocity to carry in other states. Non-residents at least 21 years of age who have a permit from their home state may also apply. Some areas are off-limits, including courthouses and secured areas of airports. Concealed carry permits require a firearms familiarity course that has been certified by the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI). In terms of reciprocity, since Utah has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit.


### Self-Defense


Utah is a Castle Doctrine state (called defense of habitation) and has a "stand your ground" law. There is no duty to retreat if a person feels deadly force is justified to prevent a felony from being committed any place where a person has a legal right to be.


#### Force in Defense of Person


An individual is justified in threatening or using force when and to the extent that the individual reasonably believes that force or a threat of force is necessary to defend the individual or another individual against the imminent use of unlawful force. An individual is justified in using deadly force only if the individual reasonably believes that force is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to the individual or another individual as a result of imminent use of unlawful force, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.


#### Force in Defense of Property


A person is justified in using force, other than deadly force, when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that force is necessary to prevent or terminate another person’s criminal interference with real property or personal property lawfully in the person’s possession, lawfully in the possession of a member of the person’s immediate family, or belonging to a person whose property the person has a legal duty to protect.


#### Civil and Criminal Immunity


The person using deadly force in defense of personal or real property is presumed for the purpose of both civil and criminal cases to have acted reasonably and to have had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the trespass or attempted trespass is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, or in a violent and tumultuous manner or for the purpose of committing a forcible felony.


#### Force in Defense of Habitation


A person is justified in using force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other’s unlawful entry into or attack upon his habitation. The individual is justified in the use of deadly force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury only if the entry is made or attempted in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously, or by stealth, and he reasonably believes that the entry is attempted or made for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any person, dwelling, or being in the habitation and he reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the assault or offer of personal violence or if the individual reasonably believes that the entry is made or attempted for the purpose of committing a felony in the habitation and that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of the felony.


#### Deadly Force in Defense of Persons on Real Property


A person is justified in using deadly force in his defense of persons on real property other than his habitation if he or she is in lawful possession of the real property, reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other person’s trespass onto the real property, and the trespass is made or attempted by use of force or in a violent and tumultuous manner. The person reasonably believes that the trespass is attempted or made for the purpose of committing violence against any person on the real property and he or she reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent personal violence, or the person reasonably believes that the trespass is made or attempted for the purpose of committing a forcible felony that poses imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury to a person on the real property and that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of that forcible felony.
