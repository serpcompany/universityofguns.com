Maryland: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Maryland gun laws require a permit to purchase, a background check, and firearms registration to buy a handgun from a private individual. Private firearms sellers must process transfers of handguns and assault weapons through a licensed dealer or designated law enforcement agency, who then conducts a background check. [Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety § 5-118]


Open and concealed carry are legal in Maryland only for Maryland Wear/Carry Handgun Permit (WCHP) holders. In order to obtain a WCHP, applicants must be at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for employment purposes only). WCHPs require a state-approved 16-hour firearms training course that includes live-fire training. [Md. Code Ann., Pub. Safety § 5-306]


### Self-Defense


Maryland follows common law principles making it a Castle Doctrine state. There is a duty to retreat, requiring people who are outside of their homes to retreat or avoid danger if possible before using deadly force to defend themselves. Deadly force is only legal when defending one’s self from the immediate threat of serious injury or death. [Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 4-101]


#### Conditions for using deadly force


A person must have reasonable grounds to believe themselves in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from their assailant or potential assailant, must have in fact believed themselves in this danger, must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict, and the force used must have not been unreasonable and excessive. [Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 2-503]


#### Protection against liability for using deadly force


A person is not liable for damages for a personal injury or death of an individual who enters the person’s dwelling or place of business if the person reasonably believes that force or deadly force is necessary to repel an attack by the individual and the amount and nature of the force used by the person is reasonable under the circumstances. [Md. Code Ann., Courts and Judicial Proceedings § 5-808]
