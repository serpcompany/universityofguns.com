Massachusetts: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------------


Massachusetts is a shall-issue state for License to Carry (LTC) since the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. LTCs are issued at the local police station or, for non-residents, through the State Police Firearms Records Bureau. A Firearm Identification (FID) card or LTC is required to purchase a firearm, and a background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual. Sellers must verify the buyer’s Firearm Identification Card with the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services. Although handgun registration is not required, all sellers of firearms must report firearms sales and transfers to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which maintains comprehensive records of sales and transfers. An LTC is also required to buy ammunition. 


### Self-Defense


Massachusetts is a Castle Doctrine state. According to Massachusetts law, if a person is an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring one who was unlawfully in the dwelling, it is a defense that the occupant was in one’s dwelling at the time of the offense and that he or she acted in the reasonable belief that the person unlawfully in the dwelling was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon the occupant, and that the occupant used reasonable means to defend himself or herself or another person lawfully in the dwelling. There is no duty to retreat in a person’s dwelling, although there is a duty to retreat outside of one’s home. 


#### Minimum Age for LTC


The minimum age for a Massachusetts LTC is 21 years old. [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 § 131]


#### Concealed Carry


Concealed carry is legal in Massachusetts for individuals who have a Massachusetts LTC or a formerly issued, valid Class A LTC. LTCs require a state-approved firearms training course. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and airports. Massachusetts does not honor permits from any other states. [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 § 131]
