Nevada: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------


Nevada is a shall-issue state with concealed carry permits issued at the county level. 


No permit or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual in Nevada. As of January 2, 2020, all sales are required to be conducted through a licensed federal firearms dealer with a background check, with exceptions for some temporary transfers and sales or transfers of firearms between immediate family members. 


Open carry is legal in Nevada without a permit. Anyone 18 and older who can legally possess a firearm may openly carry virtually anywhere in the state. For open carry in a vehicle, the firearm may be anywhere except concealed upon the person without a concealed firearms permit. Open carry is actually legal in more places than concealed carry is. Signs on public buildings only prohibit concealed carry. Areas that are off-limits include school premises, including parking lots and wherever legislature is conducting business. 


### Concealed Carry in Nevada


Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Nevada Firearm permit and for non-residents with a license/permit from a state Nevada honors. To apply for a Concealed Firearm Permit, a person must be 21 (18 for military), complete an approved course in firearm safety and demonstrate competence (qualify) with any handgun. Both residents and non-residents can obtain permits. Some areas are off-limits, such as school premises, including parking lots, and inside public airports. In terms of reciprocity, Nevada recognizes permits from states that meet specific criteria and maintains the list on its website. [[NRS-202.3657](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-202.html#NRS202Sec365)]


#### Resistance by Party About to Be Injured


Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the party about to be injured:


* To prevent an offense against his or her person, family or some member of his or her family; or
* To prevent an illegal attempt — by force — to take or injure property in his or her lawful possession.


**Resistance by Other Persons** Any other person, in aid or defense of a person about to be injured, may make resistance sufficient to prevent the offense. [[NRS-200.120](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec120)]


#### Justifiable Homicide


Homicide is justified in necessary self-defense or in defense of an occupied habitation, an occupied motor vehicle, or a person against one who manifestly intends or endeavors to commit a crime of violence, or against any person or persons who manifestly intend and endeavor, in a violent, riotous, tumultuous, or surreptitious manner, to enter the occupied habitation or occupied motor vehicle of another for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any person dwelling or being within. This only applies if the person is not the original aggressor, has a right to be present at the location where deadly force is used and is not actively engaged in a criminal activity. [[NRS-200.120](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec120)]


“Crime of violence” means any felony for which there is a substantial risk that force or violence may be used against the person or property of another in the commission of the felony. “Motor vehicle” means every vehicle which is self-propelled. “Residence” means any house, room, apartment, tenement or other building, vehicle, vehicle trailer, semitrailer, house trailer or boat designed or intended for occupancy as a residence. [[NRS-200.130](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec130)]


#### Self-Defense


Nevada is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. There is no duty to retreat inside one’s home or place of work. In Nevada, the use of force for self-defense must meet certain criteria. The force used must be immediately necessary, must be in good faith and must be a reasonable response to the aggressor’s actions. [[NRS-200.120](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec120)]


#### Immunity from Civil Liability


Force which is intended or likely to cause death or bodily injury is immune from civil liability or the wrongful death of a person against whom such force was used if the use of such force was justified. [[NRS-193.240](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-193.html#NRS193Sec240), [NRS-193.250](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-193.html#NRS193Sec240), [NRS-200.120](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-200.html#NRS200Sec120), and [NRS-41.095](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-041.html#NRS041Sec095)]
