Arkansas: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Arkansas is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with concealed weapons licenses being issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.


There is no license, background check or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.


It is now clear that permitless open carry is legal without a license in Arkansas for any person who is at least 18 years old and who can legally possess a firearm. As of October 17, 2018, the Arkansas Appeals Court stated in case [CR-18-353](https://law.justia.com/cases/arkansas/court-of-appeals/2018/cr-18-353.html) Jamie Taff v. State of Arkansas, “Under the clear language of § 5-73-120(a), the possessor of a handgun must have an unlawful intent to employ it as a weapon against a person in order to make that possession a criminal act.” Some areas are off-limits, including schools and bars.


Concealed carry is legal without a license for anyone that is over 18 who can legally possess a firearm and on a journey (outside of a person’s home or property). Concealed Handgun Carry Licenses (CHCL) are issued to residents at least 21 years of age or 18 years of age if a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard and require a firearms training course that has been state-approved. Arkansas offers two types of handgun carry licenses, the CHCL and an Enhanced concealed carry licenses (E-CHCL) which allows for carrying in some forbidden areas such as public colleges, most public buildings, non-secure locations in airports, churches and more. The E-CHCL requires approximately 8 hours of additional classroom and gun-range training. Although Arkansas doesn’t issue non-resident licenses, active-duty military and their spouses may apply for an Arkansas CHCL. In terms of reciprocity, since Arkansas has permitless carry, anyone who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit.


### Use of Physical Force


A person is justified in using a degree of physical force that he or she reasonably believes to be necessary to defend him or herself or a third person from the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force.


#### Use of Deadly Physical Force in Defense of a Person


A person is justified in using deadly physical force if the person reasonably believes that the other person is:


* Committing or about to commit a felony involving physical force or violence;
* Using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force; or
* A pattern of domestic abuse.


A person is not required to retreat before using deadly physical force if the person:


* Is lawfully present at the location where deadly physical force is used;
* Has a reasonable belief that the person against whom the deadly physical force is used is imminently threatening to cause death or serious physical injury to the person or another person;
* Is not the initial aggressor and has not provoked the person against whom the deadly physical force is used; and
* Is not engaged in criminal activity. [Ark. Code § 5-2-607]


#### Defense of Premises


A person in lawful possession or control of premises or a vehicle is justified in using non-deadly physical force when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by the other person in or upon the premises or vehicle.


A person may use deadly physical force if the person reasonably believes the use of deadly physical force is necessary to prevent the commission of arson or burglary by a trespasser. [Ark. Code § 5-2-621]


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property


A person is justified in using non-deadly physical force when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief or the subsequent flight from the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief. [Ark. Code § 5-2-606]


The Castle Doctrine in Arkansas indicates that the right of an individual to defend himself or herself and the life of a person or property in the individual’s home against harm, injury or loss by a person unlawfully entering or attempting to enter or intrude into the home is a fundamental right to be preserved and promoted as a public policy in the state. **As of March 3, 2021 Arkansas has a “stand your ground” law**, and there is no duty to retreat before force can be used for self-defense anywhere a person is lawfully allowed to be.
