Connecticut: Gun Laws Summary
-----------------------------


Connecticut is a may-issue state, meaning that local law enforcement has discretion in determining whether or not to issue a permit to carry a handgun to an applicant based on a “suitability clause”. [[1](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_529.htm#sec_29-28)] The suitability clause applies both to the issuance of new permits and revocation of existing permits. There is a two-step process to obtain a permit. First, an applicant must apply for a temporary permit from the local authorities and then they must submit another application at the state level through the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP). 


In order to purchase a handgun, a buyer must have a Connecticut Pistol Permit (CTPP) or obtain a Certificate of Eligibility for Pistol and Revolvers or Long Guns or Ammunition. [[2](https://portal.ct.gov/DESPP/Division-of-State-Police/Special-Licensing-and-Firearms/Firearms-Unit---CCW)] A background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual — private party firearms transfers are required to be performed by a federally licensed dealer. 


Open carry and concealed carry are legal in Connecticut with a CTPP. The minimum age is 21. [[1](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_529.htm#sec_29-28)] Connecticut residents as well as non-residents with a valid CCW license from their home state can apply for a CTPP.  [[2](https://portal.ct.gov/DESPP/Division-of-State-Police/Special-Licensing-and-Firearms/Firearms-Unit---CCW)] Some areas are off-limits, including schools and state parks. [[1](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_529.htm#sec_29-28)] CTPPs require a state-approved firearms training course that includes live-fire exercises. In terms of reciprocity, Connecticut does not honor permits from any other states. [[2](https://portal.ct.gov/DESPP/Division-of-State-Police/Special-Licensing-and-Firearms/Firearms-Unit---CCW)]


### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Person


A person is justified in using reasonable **physical force** to defend the person or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and the person may use such degree of force which is reasonably believed to be necessary for such purpose; except that **deadly physical force** may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force, or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. [[3](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_952.htm#sec_53a-19)]


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property


A person is justified in using **reasonable physical force** when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes it to be necessary to prevent an attempt to commit larceny or criminal mischief involving property or larceny; but he or she may use **deadly physical force** only in defense of person. [[4](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_952.htm#sec_53a-20)]


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Premises


A person in possession or control of premises, or a person who is licensed or privileged to be in or upon such premises, is justified in using reasonable **physical force** when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass. But a person may use **deadly physical force** under such circumstances only:


* In defense of a person;
* When he or she reasonably believes it to be necessary to prevent an attempt by the trespasser to commit arson or any crime of violence; or
* To the extent that he or she reasonably believes it to be necessary to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry by force into a dwelling or place of work, and for the sole purpose of such prevention or termination. [[5](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_952.htm#sec_53a-21)]


#### Self-Defense


The Castle Doctrine is incorporated into Connecticut law governing the use of physical force in defense of premises. Although there is no duty to retreat in a person’s home, there is a duty to retreat outside of one’s home. [[3](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_952.htm#sec_53a-19)]
