Georgia: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Georgia is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level and filed with the probate court in the county of residence. There is no license, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. 


### Open and Concealed Carry


Open carry is legal in Georgia only with a Georgia Weapons Carry License (WCL) or a concealed carry permit from a state Georgia honors. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and courthouses. Open carry is not addressed in the constitutional carry bill that was signed into law on April 12, 2022. Concealed carry is legal for residents of Georgia with a WCL, any lawful weapons carrier, and non-residents with a license/permit issued by any other state. No license is needed to carry a handgun in a person's home, vehicle, place of business, while fishing or hunting, or unloaded in a case. You must be at least 21 years old (18 for members of the military) to get a concealed carry license in Georgia. 


#### Reciprocity


The city of Kennesaw has a law enacted in 1982 requiring every head of household within city limits to maintain a firearm. In terms of reciprocity, Governor Kemp signed HB 218 into law on April 12, 2022, recognizing firearms licenses from all other states. Holders of licenses that expired during the COVID state of emergency period must apply for a renewal license within 120 days of the expiration date on the face of the license.


### Self-Defense


Georgia is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” statute. There is no duty to retreat in defense of a forcible felony, such as rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping.


#### Defense of Habitation and Property


A person is justified in threatening or using force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such threat or force is necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry into or attack upon a habitation. The use of deadly force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to prevent trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property other than a habitation or personal property is only justified if it is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony. "Habitation" means any dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business. "Personal property" means personal property other than a motor vehicle.
