Colorado: Gun Laws Summary

Colorado Gun Laws
-----------------


Colorado is a shall-issue state where concealed carry permits are issued by local sheriff’s offices to county residents. No purchase permits or firearms registration are required for handguns. Private-party transfers of firearms require a background check of the buyer and transfer approval from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.


Open carry is legal for any person who is at least 18 years old and who can legally possess a firearm, except in Denver County and other posted areas. Local governments may enact regulations prohibiting open carrying of firearms in a building or specific area within the local government’s jurisdiction, as long as signs are posted to that effect.


Concealed carry is legal in Colorado for residents with a Colorado permit to carry a concealed weapon (CCW) and non-residents with a CCW permit from a state that Colorado honors. CCW permits can be issued to any resident at least 21 years old and not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm. A state-approved firearms training course is required for a concealed carry permit. Colorado doesn’t issue non-resident permits with the exception of members of the military permanently stationed in Colorado and their immediate family members that live in the state. Colorado will only honor resident CCW licenses from states with which it has a reciprocity agreement.


### Self-Defense


Colorado is a Castle Doctrine state. It grants its citizens the “right to expect absolute safety within their own homes.” There is no duty to retreat, and the law applies at a person’s residence or in another dwelling. Although the state does not have an express stand your ground law, the Colorado Supreme Court has affirmed Colorado does not include a duty to retreat and “permits non-aggressors to stand their ground when acting in self-defense.”


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property


A person is justified in using reasonable and appropriate physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes it necessary to prevent an attempt to commit theft, criminal mischief or criminal tampering involving property. Deadly physical force can only be used under these circumstances in defense of oneself or another.


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of a Person


A person is justified in using any degree of force which he or she reasonably believes to be necessary in order to defend the person or a third person from the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. Deadly physical force can be used under these circumstances in defense of oneself or another.


#### Use of Deadly Physical Force Against an Intruder


Any occupant of a dwelling is justified in using any degree of physical force, including deadly physical force, when the occupant has a reasonable belief someone has unlawfully entered the occupant’s dwelling and is committing a crime in the dwelling in addition to the uninvited entry, is committing or intends to commit a crime against a person or property in addition to the uninvited entry, and when the occupant reasonably believes that such other person might use any physical force — no matter how slight — against any occupant.


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Premises


A person in possession or control of any building, realty or other premises, or a person who is licensed or privileged to be there, is justified in using reasonable and appropriate physical force when and to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to prevent or terminate what he or she believes to be the commission or attempted commission of an unlawful trespass by the other person in or upon the building, realty or premises. Deadly force can only be used in defense of oneself or another, or when he or she reasonably believes it necessary to prevent what he or she reasonably believes to be an attempt by the trespasser to commit first-degree arson.


#### Civil and Criminal Immunity


Any occupant of a dwelling using justified physical force, including deadly physical force, in accordance with the provisions of the law shall be immune from criminal prosecution for the use of such force as well as any civil liability for injuries or death resulting from the use of such force. [Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ [18-1-704](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-1-704.html), [18-1-704.5](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-1-704-5.html), [18-1-705](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-1-705.html), & [18-1-706](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-1-706.html)]
