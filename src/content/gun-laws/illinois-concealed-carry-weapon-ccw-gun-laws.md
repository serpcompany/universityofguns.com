# Illinois: Gun Laws Summary

Illinois is a shall-issue state, meaning that Illinois State Police must issue a concealed carry license if the applicant meets certain qualifications. ([720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1, 5/7-2 & 5/7-3](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39))

### Self-Defense

Illinois is a Castle Doctrine state. You are under no legal duty to retreat if threatened, and using deadly force is justified.

#### Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or another against such other’s imminent use of unlawful force. ([720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1, 5/7-2 & 5/7-3](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39))

#### Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with either real property (other than a dwelling) or personal property, lawfully in one’s possession or in the possession of another who is a member of his or her immediate family or household or of a person whose property one has a legal duty to protect. ([720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1, 5/7-2 & 5/7-3](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39))

#### Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling

A person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry into or attack upon a dwelling. ([720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1, 5/7-2 & 5/7-3](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39))

Open carry of a handgun on your person or in a vehicle is illegal.

An Illinois Concealed Carry License (CCL) is required to concealed carry a firearm in Illinois. Applicants must be 21 or older. The license permits the licensee to carry a loaded or unloaded handgun on or about the person completely or mostly concealed from view of the public or on or about a person within a vehicle. A 16-hour firearms training course conducted by a state-approved instructor is required for all new concealed carry license applications. ([430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 66/10](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39))

Illinois law requires residents to have a Firearm Owners Identification Card (FOID) to possess a firearm or ammunition. FOID card holders (without a CCL) can legally carry unloaded firearms that are enclosed in a case. You must be 21 years old to apply and have a FOID card. ([430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 65/2](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1657&ChapterID=39))

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FOID card holders & CCL licensees who submit their renewal application will remain valid during the duration of the state’s disaster proclamation and for a period of 18 months following the termination of the disaster, even if their renewal application is/was not submitted prior to expiration. Under the emergency rule, a FOID card or concealed carry license that has expired since the start of the pandemic is still considered valid as long as the holder has applied for renewal, paid the required fees, and the card is not subject to revocation, meaning the person has not committed an offense that would otherwise disqualify them from holding the permit. In addition, CCL licensees will not be required to immediately submit proof of three-hour training with their CCL renewal application but will need to submit proof of their training within 18 months following the termination of the state’s disaster proclamation in order to maintain the validity of their CCL license.

Non-resident licenses are only available for residents of Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. In terms of reciprocity, Illinois does not honor CCW licenses from any other state.

#### Assault Weapons Ban

On Jan. 10, 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker (D) signed HB 5471, or the Protect Illinois Communities Act, into law. The law makes it unlawful to deliver, sell or purchase, or cause to be delivered, possessed or sold or purchased by another, an assault weapon, assault weapon attachment, .50 caliber rifle or .50 caliber cartridge. It makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly possess an assault weapon, .50 caliber rifle or .50 caliber cartridge 300 days after the effective date of the amendatory act, except possession of weapons registered with the Illinois State Police in the time provided.

An assault weapon is defined as:

- any rifle that has a belt-fed ammunition system or which has a detachable magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition
- a semi-automatic rifle that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has any of the following

* a folding or telescoping stock
* a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the non-trigger hand without being burned

- a semi-automatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has any of the following:

* a folding or telescoping stock
* a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles the barrel, that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the non-trigger hand without being burned
* a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded

- a semi-automatic rifle with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition
- a semi-automatic shotgun that has:

* a folding or telescoping stock
* contains its ammunition in a revolving cylinder
* a fixed magazine capacity in excess of five rounds of ammunition, except as may be authorized under the Wildlife Code and excluding magazine extensions during the snow geese conservation order season
* an ability to accept a detachable magazine of more than five rounds of ammunition

([720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24-1, 5/7-2 & 5/7-3](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=4277&ChapterID=53))

| Can You Concealed Carry Weapons Other Than Handguns in Illinois with a Concealed Carry License (or Under Permitless Carry if Applicable)? | An Illinois concealed carry license does not cover weapons other than handguns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Is It Legal to Own a Taser or Stun Gun in Illinois?                                                                                       | Yes. Tasers are legal to purchase with a valid FOID or an Illinois concealed carry license. Based on the passage of [HB 562](https://legiscan.com/IL/bill/HB0562/2021), beginning on **January 1, 2024,** the buyer must keep a record of the transfer for a period of 10 years and provide a record of the transfer within 10 days to a FFL. The federally licensed firearm dealer must maintain the transfer record for 20 years from date of receipt. A federally licensed firearm dealer may charge a fee not to exceed $25 to retain the record. Note: On March 21, 2019, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that what was essentially a comprehensive ban that prohibited carrying stun guns and Tasers in public in 720 ILCS 5/24-1(a)(4) was unconstitutional. The court didn’t mention the provision in the same statute that makes it illegal to carry stun guns and Tasers on public streets or public land within city limits. It’s not clear whether that prohibition could still be enforced or would withstand a legal challenge in light of the Webb decision.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Does Illinois Have Magazine Capacity Restrictions for Handguns?                                                                           | Yes.

"Armor piercing bullet" means any handgun bullet or handgun ammunition with projectiles or projectile cores, or fully jacketed bullets larger than 22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25% of the total weight of the projectile, and excluding those handgun projectiles whose cores are composed of soft materials such as copper, lead or lead alloys, zinc or zinc alloys, frangible projectiles designed primarily for sporting purposes, and any other projectiles or projectile cores that the U. S. Secretary of the Treasury finds to be primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes or industrial purposes or that otherwise does not constitute "armor piercing ammunition" as that term is defined by federal law. Residents must obtain a **Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card** in order to buy ammunition. Even if buying ammo outside the state, residents need that FOID card and a driver's license or state-issued identification card in order to take shipment of ammunition. [[720 Ill. Comp.

| Does Illinois have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?                                        | Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Illinois. The regulation, licensing, possession, registration, and transportation of handguns and ammunition for handguns by concealed handgun licensees are exclusive powers and functions of the State. Any ordinance or regulation, or portion thereof that purports to impose regulations or restrictions on licensees or handguns and ammunition for handguns shall be invalid in its application to licensees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Local municipalities can regulate:

- Individuals who do not possess a valid FOID card or CCL;
- Firearms other than handguns; and
- Matters related to the sale, purchase and storage of all firearms.

  [430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 66/70(d)](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497)
  As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgement, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences. |
  | Do you have a duty to notify a police officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Illinois? | No. There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Illinois unless the officer asks.
  [430 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 66/10(h)](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3497&ChapterID=39) |
  | Is my Illinois driver’s license linked to my Illinois carry license? | Yes. Your Illinois driver’s license is linked to your Illinois concealed carry license. Therefore, a law enforcement officer will be notified immediately that you are a concealed carry license holder if they run your driver’s license. |
  | If yes, violating the sign would be considered to be a crime. If no, violating the sign would not be considered a criminal offense. | Yes. Signs stating that the carrying of firearms is prohibited must be clearly and conspicuously posted at the entrance of a building, premises or real property specified as a [prohibited area](#loc_res), unless the building or premises is a private residence.
