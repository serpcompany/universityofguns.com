Vermont: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Vermont is a constitutional carry state, meaning that individuals who can legally possess a firearm are allowed to carry openly or concealed without a permit. [Vt. Stat. Ann. [§ 4001](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/13/085/04000)]


There are some restrictions on gun sales in Vermont. All gun sales must be completed through a licensed firearms dealer unless the transfer is to a family member. Buyers under 21 years old must have completed a Vermont hunters course (or equivalent) or be a member or former member of the military, active or veteran member of the National Guard, or law enforcement. Vermont does not require permits to purchase and has no firearms registration. [Vt. Stat. Ann. [§ 4006](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/13/085/04006)]

[Vt. Stat. Ann. [§ 2305](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/13/053/02305)]
