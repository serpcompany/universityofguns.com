Oklahoma: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Oklahoma is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Licenses are processed at the county level by the local sheriff’s office.


No permit is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, there is no waiting period and there is no firearms registration in the state. A background check is required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer.


Open carry is legal without a license, for anyone that can legally own a firearm and is at least 21 years old (or at least 18 years old for members or veterans of the U.S. military) in lawful self-defense and self-protection or any other legitimate purpose such as hunting, fishing, educational or recreational purposes. Some areas are off-limits, including public government buildings.


Oklahoma has permitless carry. It allows anyone who is at least 21 years old (or at least 18 years old and is a member of the military or honorably discharged veteran) that can legally own a firearm to openly or concealed carry without a license. Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation’s Self-Defense Act Licenses (SDAL) are issued to residents and military personnel and their spouses stationed in Oklahoma only. A person must be 21 or older, have completed a firearms course and meet other criteria to apply. There are restrictions on the caliber of the firearm a license holder can carry with, .45 caliber being the highest. Licenses are not available for non-residents. In terms of reciprocity, Oklahoma recognizes permits issued by all other states. In addition, residents of other permitless carry states can carry in the state.


### Immunity from Civil & Criminal Liability


A person who uses justified defensive force is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such defensive force.
 [Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1289.25](https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=69782)


#### Self-Defense


Oklahoma is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” statute. There is no duty to retreat, and the law applies any place where a person has a right to be. A person has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.


A person within a place of worship or at a business is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if:


* The person against whom the defensive force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering or had unlawfully entered a dwelling, residence, occupied vehicle, place of business or place of worship, or if that person had removed or was attempting to remove another against the person’s will; or
* The person who uses defensive force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring or had occurred; or
* The person who uses defensive force knew or had a reasonable belief that the person against whom the defensive force was used entered or was attempting to enter into a dwelling, residence, occupied vehicle, place of business or place of worship for the purpose of committing a forcible felony, and that the defensive force was necessary to prevent the commission of the forcible felony.


“Dwelling” means a building or conveyance of any kind, including any attached porch, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it, including a tent, and is designed to be occupied by people.


“Residence” means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest.
