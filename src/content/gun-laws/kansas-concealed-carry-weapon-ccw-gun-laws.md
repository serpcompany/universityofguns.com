Kansas: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------


As a shall-issue, permitless carry state, Kansas does not require licenses to purchase handguns or firearms registration. Private sales do not require background checks, but they are necessary for purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer, with the exception of Kansas concealed carry handgun license holders. 


### Carry Laws in Kansas


Open and concealed carry are legal without a license in Kansas. Anyone legally entitled to possess a firearm can openly carry a firearm in public without a license or permit. Anyone at least 21 years old can carry a concealed firearm without a permit if they are not prohibited from carrying a firearm. Carry Handgun Licenses (CCHLs) are restricted to residents and members of the military stationed in Kansas. 


#### Requirements for Carry Handgun Licenses


Applicants must complete an 8-hour handgun safety and training course approved by the attorney general. The minimum age to obtain a provisional CCHL is 18 years old and 21 years old to obtain a standard CCHL.


#### Reciprocity


Since Kansas has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit. As of July 1, 2021, all valid concealed carry licenses/permits issued by another jurisdiction are recognized in Kansas for non-residents.


Individuals under 21 years of age may conceal carry only when on their own land, abode, or fixed place of business. The minimum age to possess a firearm with a barrel less than 12 inches long is 18 years old. There are other exceptions for 18-year-olds, including when attending a firearms safety course, target shooting at established ranges, or when hunting.


### Self-Defense Laws in Kansas


Kansas is a Castle Doctrine state and has adopted a “stand your ground” statute. There is no duty to retreat anywhere a person has a legal right to be. 


#### Defense of Dwelling, Place of Work or Occupied Vehicle


A person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such use of force is necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry into or attack upon such person’s dwelling, place of work or occupied vehicle. A person is justified in the use of deadly force to prevent or terminate unlawful entry into or attack upon any dwelling, place of work or occupied vehicle if such person reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to such person or another. [Kan. Stat. Ann § 21-5222]


#### Defense of Person


A person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such use of force is necessary to defend the person or a third person against the imminent use of unlawful force. A person is justified in the use of deadly force if such person reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to such person or a third person. [Kan. Stat. Ann § 21-5223]


#### Defense of Property Other Than Dwelling, Place of Work or Occupied Vehicle


A person who is lawfully in possession of property other than a dwelling, place of work or occupied vehicle is justified in the use of force for the purpose of preventing or terminating an unlawful interference with such property. Only such use of force as a reasonable person would deem necessary to prevent or terminate the interference may intentionally be used. [Kan. Stat. Ann § 21-5224 & 21-5225]
