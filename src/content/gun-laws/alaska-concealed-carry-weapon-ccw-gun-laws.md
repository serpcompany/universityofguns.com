Alaska: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------


Alaska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There is no firearms registration, no permit is required to purchase firearms and no background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual.


Open carry is legal in Alaska for any person who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. The minimum age to open carry is 21. Some areas are off-limits, including K-12 schools and any place where intoxicating liquor is sold for on-site consumption. [[11.61.220](https://codes.findlaw.com/ak/title-11-criminal-law/ak-st-sect-11-61-220.html), [11.61.210](https://codes.findlaw.com/ak/title-11-criminal-law/ak-st-sect-11-61-210.html)]


### Concealed Carry


Concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years of age or older who can legally possess a firearm — a permit is not required. Residents who are seeking to be exempt from background checks when purchasing additional firearms or who want to carry a firearm in other states can obtain a concealed handgun permit to use in states with which Alaska has a reciprocity agreement. Concealed handgun permits are issued by the Alaska State Police and require a firearms training course that has been state-approved. Alaska does not issue permits to non-residents. In terms of reciprocity, since Alaska has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit.

### Use of Non-Deadly Force in Defense of Self


A person is justified in using non-deadly force when and to the extent the person reasonably believes it is necessary for self-defense against the use of unlawful force by the other person, unless:


* The person used the force in mutual combat not authorized by law;
* The person claiming self-defense provoked the other’s conduct;
* The person claiming self-defense was the initial aggressor; or
* The person claiming self-defense possessed a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument while committing a felony or exacting revenge.

### Immunity: Use of Defensive Force


Any person who uses a gun in self-defense has immunity from criminal and civil law.
