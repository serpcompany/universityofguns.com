North Dakota: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------------


North Dakota is a shall-issue state, although law enforcement has some discretion in issuing licenses to anyone they have reason to believe is or has been a danger to self or others. Concealed carry licenses are issued at the state level by the attorney general.


### Permitless Carry in North Dakota


The state allows permitless concealed carry for adults that have been residents for at least 30 days and are not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm and for non-residents with a valid resident concealed carry license from a state that North Dakota honors. On April 12, 2023, Governor Doug Burgum signed HB 1339, allowing non-residents the ability to concealed carry under North Dakota’s permitless carry laws. It will also remove the 30-day requirement for IDs. The new law will go into effect on August 1, 2023. Individuals concealed carrying under permitless carry must carry their driver’s license or state ID and MUST inform law enforcement that they are in possession of the firearm upon any in-person contact by a law enforcement officer. Restrictions on places that a firearm may be possessed still apply. Concealed carry is also legal for non-residents with permits from states that North Dakota recognizes.


#### Concealed Weapon Licenses in North Dakota


North Dakota issues Class 1 and Class 2 CWLs. Both licenses are equally valid within North Dakota, but because of additional testing requirements, the holders of a Class 1 license have reciprocity in many more states than those who hold a Class 2 license. CWLs require completion of a state-certified firearms training course. North Dakota issues licenses to full-time active military duty stationed in ND and non-residents if they have a concealed carry permit from their home state, which must have reciprocity with North Dakota. The home state is determined by the driver’s license. In terms of reciprocity, there is some confusion. It appears that as of August 1, 2021, when [HB 1293](https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-0774-04000.pdf) went into effect, North Dakota will only honor resident permits from the states it honors. 


#### Open Carry in North Dakota


Open carry of handguns is legal for residents with a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) and for non-residents with a valid resident concealed carry license from a state that North Dakota honors. The minimum age is 18. Some areas are off-limits, including bars.


### Use of Force in Defense of Premises and Property


Force is justified to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass in or upon premises, or to prevent an unlawful carrying away or damaging of property.


#### Immunity From Civil Liability for Justifiable Use of Force


Force which is intended or likely to cause death or bodily injury is immune from civil liability or the wrongful death of a person against whom such force was used if the use of such force was justified. [[N.D. Cent. Code §§ 12.1-05-03 thru 12.1-05-07.2](https://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c05.pdf?20150810004235)]


#### Self-Defense or the Defense of Others


A person is justified in using force to defend himself or herself against danger of imminent unlawful bodily injury, sexual assault or detention by another person. A person is justified in using force in order to defend anyone else if the person defended would be justified in defending himself or herself.


#### Deadly Force


The use of deadly force is not justified if it can be avoided, with safety to the actor and others, by retreat or other conduct involving minimal interference with the freedom of the individual menaced. An individual seeking to protect another individual must, before using deadly force, try to cause the other individual to retreat, or otherwise comply with the requirements of this provision, if safety can be obtained thereby. An individual is not justified in using more force than is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.There is no duty to retreat anywhere a person is legally allowed to be. Deadly force is justified in the following instances: When used in lawful self-defense or in lawful defense of others, if such force is necessary to protect the actor or anyone else against death, serious bodily injury or the commission of a violent felony; or When used by an individual in possession or control of a dwelling, place of work, motor vehicle or an occupied motor home or travel trailer, or by an individual who is licensed or privileged to be there, if the force is necessary to prevent commission of arson, burglary, robbery or a violent felony upon or in the dwelling, place of work, motor vehicle or occupied motor home or travel trailer, and the use of force other than deadly force for these purposes would expose any individual to substantial danger of serious bodily injury. [[N.D. Cent. Code §§ 12.1-05-03 thru 12.1-05-07.2](https://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c05.pdf?20150810004235)]
