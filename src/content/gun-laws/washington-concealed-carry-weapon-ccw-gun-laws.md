Washington: Gun Laws Summary
----------------------------


Washington is a shall-issue state, with licenses issued at the local level by the sheriff or police department. Private sales of firearms in Washington require a Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) and a background check, and firearms registration is required for retail dealers. 


### Open and Concealed Carry


Open carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years old who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including public schools and state courthouses. According to [SB 5038](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5038&Year=2021), open carry is also prohibited at the Capitol, any state legislative office, any public legislative hearing or meeting and within 250 feet of a permitted demonstrations. A valid permit/license is required to carry a loaded handgun in any vehicle in Washington. Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Washington Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and for non-residents with a license/permit from a state that Washington honors. CPLs are issued to residents and non-residents that are at least 21 years old. There is no current requirement to attend a firearms training course. 


#### Self-Defense


Washington does not have a specific castle law, but the Washington State Supreme Court has ruled that there is no duty to retreat if a person is in a place they have the lawful right to occupy and is being assaulted.


#### Use of Force


The use of force is justified in preventing or attempting to prevent an offense against a person or property lawfully in their possession, provided the force is not more than necessary. The use of force is also justified to detain someone who enters or remains unlawfully in a building or on real property lawfully in the possession of the person, so long as the detention is reasonable in duration and manner to investigate the reason for the detained person’s presence on the premises.


#### Justifiable Homicide


Homicide is justifiable when committed in reasonable defense against a felony or the imminent danger of great personal injury to any person, or in resisting of a felony in or upon a dwelling or other place of abode, in which they are.
