Oregon: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------


Oregon is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, with applications processed at the county level by the local sheriff's office. Oregon Concealed Handgun Licenses (CHLs) require an applicant to be at least 21 years old and demonstrate handgun competence, which can be done through an approved firearms training course or organized shooting competition or military experience. Non-residents who live in contiguous states may apply for an Oregon CHL. 


### Private Gun Sales


No license is required to purchase a firearm in Oregon. Private-party firearms transfers must be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer while both parties are present. The dealer is required by federal law to conduct a background check and keep a record of the sale. The Oregon State Police keep records of all gun sales from firearm dealers for five years. 


#### Open Carry


Open carry is legal in Oregon without a license, although local cities and counties are authorized to place restrictions on who may open carry in public places, which includes vehicles. Some areas are off-limits, including federal facilities and Indian reservations. The minimum age for open carry is 18 years old. 


#### Use of Physical Force


A person is justified in using physical force for self-defense or to defend a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose. A person is justified in using physical force, other than deadly physical force, when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief of property, criminal trespass by another person in or upon the premises, or a burglary in a dwelling. 


#### Use of Deadly Physical Force


A person is not justified in using deadly physical force unless the person reasonably believes that the other person is committing or attempting to commit a felony involving the use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person, committing or attempting to commit a burglary in a dwelling, or using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force against a person. A person may use deadly physical force only in defense of a person or when the person reasonably believes it necessary to prevent the commission of arson or a felony by force and violence by the trespasser.
