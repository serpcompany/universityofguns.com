Arizona: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Arizona is a **shall-issue, permitless carry** state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety. There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. A purchaser must be at least 18 years old to buy a gun from a private individual. The minimum age to purchase a handgun from a federally licensed dealer is 21.


### Use of Force


A person is justified in threatening or using **physical force** when and to the extent a reasonable person would believe that physical force is immediately necessary to protect himself  or a third party against the other’s use or attempted use of unlawful physical force.


#### Use of Deadly Force


A person is justified in threatening or using physical force or **deadly force** against another: If such person would be justified in threatening or using physical force against the other; and When and to the degree a reasonable person would believe that deadly physical force is immediately necessary to protect himself or a third party against the other’s use or attempted use of unlawful deadly physical force. [(Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-405)](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00405.htm)


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Premises


A person in lawful possession or control of premises is justified in threatening to use **physical force** when and to the extent that a reasonable person would believe it immediately necessary to prevent or terminate criminal trespass in or upon the premises. A person may use **deadly force** only in the defense of himself or a third person. "Premises" means any real property and any structure — movable or immovable, permanent or temporary — adapted for both human residence and lodging whether occupied or not. [(Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-407)](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00407.htm)


#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property


A person is justified in using **physical force** when and to the extent that a reasonable person would believe it necessary to prevent theft or criminal damage involving tangible movable property. A person may use **deadly force** only in the defense of himself or a third person. [(Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-408)](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00408.htm)


#### Use of Force in Crime Prevention

[(Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-411)](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00411.htm)


#### Self-Defense


Arizona is a Castle Doctrine state and state laws effectively allow people to stand their ground. There is no duty to retreat before defending yourself if you are in a place where you may legally be and you are not engaged in an unlawful act. 


#### Civil Immunity


No person in Arizona is subject to civil liability for engaging in justified self-defense conduct. [(Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-413)](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00413.htm)
