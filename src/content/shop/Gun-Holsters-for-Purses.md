<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-purses?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-purses&utm_term=desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for a while now, and I can't recommend it enough. The exclusive sticky rubberized fabric is incredible - it really grips onto your pocket and ensures your gun stays in place. Plus, the removable and reversible outer flap is a nice touch for further concealment.

One feature that stood out for me was the low-friction draw. The slick pack cloth on the inside makes drawing your weapon a breeze, even in high-pressure situations. The added polymer reinforcement in strategic places also adds to the overall durability of the holster.

Another highlight is the design that accommodates both back and front pocket carry. This versatility is great for those who prefer different positions depending on the day or situation.

However, there are a few minor cons. Some users have reported issues with fitting the holster in their pockets, but this might vary based on individual pocket sizes or the type of clothing worn. Overall, the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a reliable, high-quality option for those looking for a comfortable and concealed pocket holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-purses?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-purses&utm_term=bulldog-small-concealed-carry-crossbody-black-1"><img alt="bulldog-small-concealed-carry-crossbody-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-small-concealed-carry-crossbody-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Bulldog Small Concealed Carry Crossbody Purse in Black and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer in my daily life. The modern design, adaptable for both left and right-handed users, is a major plus. It's not everyday that you find a crossbody bag with such versatility.

One thing that really stood out to me was the capacity of this purse. It can carry all types of small revolvers and semi-auto handguns with its color-matched, universal fit design. As someone who needs to carry essentials along with my firearm, this feature has been incredibly convenient.

The Bulldog Concealed Carry Crossbody also offers ample storage options. Features include a slash-resistant shoulder strap, 1 external zippered compartment for small accessories, 2 main zippered compartments with numerous internal pockets, and a fully lined interior throughout. All these add up to provide a well-structured, visual treat of a bag. Did I mention it's made from durable PU leather? It's 9.5"x9.5"x1.5", just the right size for most purposes.

However, no product is without its drawbacks. In my experience with the purse, I found the concealed compartment to be a bit small for some of my larger firearms. Additionally, while the universal fit design is a bonus, it might not cater to everyone's needs perfectly.

Despite these minor issues, I'm overall quite satisfied with my purchase. The Bulldog Small Concealed Carry Crossbody Purse has definitely made my life easier and safer. Its combination of capacity, design comfort, and visual appeal make it a worthy addition to any concealed carry lineup.

I recently got my hands on the Jessie & James Shelby Concealed Carry Lock and Key Crossbody CCW Handbag to enhance my personal security and style. The faux leather material and the buckle detailing make it look like a regular fashionable handbag, but the concealed compartment on the back with a lock and key feature makes it perfect for securely carrying my weapon.

The high-capacity design of the bag allows me to fit in everything I need, from my daily essentials to the removable updated holster included. The reinforced adjustable shoulder strap provides comfort and versatility in carrying it around. The exterior boasts three zip pockets and a magnet closure cell phone pocket, while the interior has a slip pocket and a zip pocket, ensuring all my belongings stay organized.

In terms of size, the handbag measures 11 inches in height, 9.5 inches in width, and 1.5 inches in depth, with a concealed compartment of 8 inches in width and 7 inches in height. The strap drop ranges from 13 to 25 inches, allowing me to adjust it according to my comfort.

Overall, the Jessie & James Shelby Concealed Carry Lock and Key Crossbody CCW Handbag has been a reliable and stylish addition to my everyday carry, providing both security and convenience. However, one drawback I noticed was that the lock mechanism occasionally stuck, requiring a little extra effort to open. Nonetheless, it's still a solid choice for anyone seeking a discreet way to carry their weapon while maintaining a sense of style.

Overall, the Browning Alexandria Concealed Carry Handbag is a stylish and functional option for women who need to carry their handguns while on the go. While there are some minor drawbacks, its practicality and durability make it worth considering for those in search of a reliable concealed carry solution.

It gives me an extra layer of security, knowing that my firearm is safely locked away when I don't need it. The compact design also ensures that I can comfortably carry this purse around without feeling weighed down.

However, this bag isn't perfect. Some users have mentioned issues with the quality of the zippers, stating that they seem to be made of plastic and can be prone to breaking. Additionally, the handles may be slightly too short for some people's comfort.

I recently got my hands on the Jessie and James Hannah Concealed Carry Crossbody Bag in black, and it has quickly become my go-to bag for daily use. The faux leather material feels incredibly smooth and refined, giving this crossbody bag a polished look that I adore.

Overall, the Girls with Guns Concealed casual tomboy clutch purse has been a game-changer for me. Not only does it serve as a reliable and secure purse for my concealed carry, but it also manages to keep all my essentials organized.
