As a frequent user of the Sports Afield SA5525INS Instinct Gun Safe, I can say it has made my life so much easier. Right from the get-go, I was impressed by its sturdy construction and sleek matte black exterior. The safe was a breeze to set up, with its fully programmable electronic lock and user-friendly software.

One of the standout features of this safe is its adjustable polymer barrel racks and included scoped rifle standoffs. This allowed me to customize the storage solution to fit my specific needs, accommodating a variety of long guns and even some of my smaller handguns.

While I have had a mostly positive experience with this safe, there are a few small hiccups worth mentioning.

Additionally, one of the two fail-safe override keys included was non-functional, which I hope will be rectified in future models.

In conclusion, the Sports Afield SA5525INS Instinct Gun Safe is a reliable and customizable storage solution for those looking to keep their firearms secure and organized.

### [Revere 64 Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=18-gun-safes&utm_term=revere-64-gun-safe-with-fire-protection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=18-gun-safes&utm_term=revere-64-gun-safe-1"><img alt="revere-64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revere-64-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to check out the Liberty Revere 64-gun safe and it's been quite the journey, to say the least. This mighty beast offers excellent security with its 2-piece roll-formed body and 4-inch military-style locking bars, making it a solid choice for storing your prized possessions.

The Revere 64 features a beautiful bronze powder coat finish, and it proudly displays the American flag on its exterior. It's worth mentioning that the build quality is quite impressive, giving me the confidence that my valuables are well-protected.

However, there are a couple of cons that came with this safe. First off, the LED lighting is quite the ordeal to install initially, but once you've got it sorted, it does a great job of brightening up the interior. Additionally, the instructions, though not the best, aren't exactly difficult to decipher.

The other main issue I had was with the locking mechanism. The default combination seemed to malfunction a few times, causing me quite a headache. Thankfully, Liberty's customer service comes to the rescue - they were super helpful in guiding me through fixing the issue.

In conclusion, the Liberty Revere 64-gun safe is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking for a secure and sturdy solution to store their valued belongings. The high-quality construction, coupled with its superior security features, makes it worthy of a spot in any home or office. Just be prepared for a potential learning curve when it comes to the lock and LED installation process!

### [Browning BX18 Secure Firearm Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=18-gun-safes&utm_term=browning-bx18-secure-firearm-storage)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/18-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=18-gun-safes&utm_term=browning-bx18-gun-safe-1"><img alt="browning-bx18-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bx18-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently had the chance to use the Browning BX18 Gun Safe in my home, and I must say, it's been an impressive addition to our security arrangements. The large capacity holds up to 18 long guns, providing ample space for all of our firearms. The electronic keypad lock offers quick and easy access, while the 3-spoke handle slides back effortlessly to engage the 4 locking bolts.

What really stood out to me was the modular shelving system. Being able to customize the space inside the safe has made organizing my collection incredibly easy. The fabric interior walls provide extra protection against any scratches or abrasions, ensuring that our firearms remain in pristine condition.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The door appears to be slightly loose-fitting, so it rattles a little when locked, which could be a concern for some buyers. Additionally, the overall build quality seems to be lacking compared to similarly-priced safes. Despite these minor issues, the Browning BX18 Gun Safe has proven to be a reliable and efficient solution for my firearm storage and protection needs.

I recently invested in a Tracker Safe TS64 Gun Safe, and I must say, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This safe offers excellent protection for my collection of firearms and valuable items.

Additionally, the adjustable shelving system allows me to customize the interior to suit my needs perfectly. I can store various types and sizes of guns without any hassle. It's also worth mentioning that the mechanical lock provides an old-school feel and saves me from worrying about battery replacements or digital malfunctions.

One minor issue I encountered was with the delivery service provided by Wayfair. They were less than helpful when it came to flipping the safe around after placing it door-facing the wall. However, this was more of a local company's fault than Wayfair's, and they promptly compensated us with a small credit for our trouble.

In conclusion, the Tracker Safe TS64 Gun Safe has been a worthwhile investment for me. Its robust construction, ample storage capacity, and reliable mechanical lock make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a secure way to store their firearms and other valuables.
