### [12x18 Dirty Bird Silhouette Targets for Pistol Practice Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-silhouette-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-silhouette-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Dirty Bird 12" x 18" Silhouette Targets for my shooting practice and I can attest to how much they've improved my experience. These targets provide a clear contrast with their black and white splattering effect, making it very easy for me to read my shot groups from a distance.

One of the best features is the non-adhesive back which allows me to easily affix them to any surface, add notes and save them for future reference. The price per target is comparable to paper targets, so not only do they provide excellent visual feedback but also save me money in the long run.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Dirty Bird Targets as they cater to all firearms and calibers. Their aiming point works great for both open and scoped sights, whether shooting indoors or outdoors. While self-adhesive backs would have been an added bonus, each pack comes with fifty sheets providing me with plenty of use before needing replacement.

### [Real Wild 3D Raccoon Archery Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="real-wild-raccoon-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/real-wild-raccoon-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Real Wild Raccoon Target, and I have to say, it's been quite an enjoyable experience. This raccoon is not only adorable but also incredibly realistic. It's perfect for practicing archery and improving your aim. The IBO scoring rings make it easy to track your progress, while the Weathercoat finish ensures that the target remains in good condition despite the elements.

One of the most impressive features of this raccoon target is its detailed design. The realistic scale details make it almost lifelike, which adds an extra layer of challenge to your practice sessions. Plus, the all foam parts ensure that it can take a beating from your arrows without falling apart quickly.

On the downside, there's not much variety when it comes to targets - just one raccoon at the moment. Also, if you're looking for something more challenging, this target might be too easy for you. However, I believe this raccoon target is perfect for beginners or those looking to have some fun while improving their archery skills.

### [Dirty Bird Multicolor Splattering Targets for Shooting Practices](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-35830-dirty-bird-multicolor-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-35830-dirty-bird-multicolor-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Multicolor Splattering Targets, and let me tell you, they've become my go-to for shooting practice. The concept behind them is ingenious - just like the standard Dirty Bird targets, their name comes from the splatter of color that appears upon bullet impact, making the hole incredibly visible even from a distance.

Each target ring reacts in a different highly-visible color, which is really helpful. You can tell by the color how close you are to the center of the bulls-eye. Plus, they're great for both indoor and outdoor use due to their heavy tagboard construction.

One of my favorite features is the non-adhesive back. This lets me stick it to any surface using a stapler, add some notes if needed, and then easily save the target for future reference. It's a nice touch that adds to the convenience of these targets.

However, there is one downside I noticed. The targets don't come with adhesive, so you'll need to use a stapler or some other way to affix them to a surface. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it might be worth considering if you're looking for a quick and easy setup.

All in all, if you're in the market for some fun and functional shooting targets, the Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Multicolor Splattering Targets are definitely worth checking out.

### [Dirty Bird Intense White Splatter Pistol Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-transitional-silhouette-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-transitional-silhouette-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Dirty Bird Transitional Silhouette Target for a few weeks now, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer! The 'intense white' splatter design is no joke - it offers superior downrange contrast that makes spotting my shots super easy. As a shooting enthusiast, I can't stress how important this feature is in helping me improve my hand-eye coordination and overall accuracy.

One of the things I absolutely love about this target is its versatility. Whether I'm practicing with different types of pistol-action shooting or just want to have some fun at the range, this target can handle it all. Plus, its heavy tagboard construction ensures that it's built to last, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

However, there's one minor downside. These targets are sold in bulk, which is great for cost savings, but it may be a bit excessive if you're only planning on using them occasionally.

Nonetheless, I highly recommend the Dirty Bird Transitional Silhouette Target to anyone looking to improve their accuracy and overall shooting proficiency. Its unique design and durable construction make it an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned shooters alike. Give it a shot (pun intended) and see the difference for yourself!

### [Zombie Splattering Target Set for Shooting Range](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/funny-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-darkotic-combo-delivery-shopping-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-darkotic-combo-delivery-shopping-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been a long-time fan of shooting ranges, and I must say, the Birchwood Casey Darkotic Combo Delivery Shopping targets have added a whole new level of excitement to my hobby. These targets 'splatter' with a halo when shot, making it incredibly easy to see where your bullets have hit. I'm particularly fond of the ones that result in a neon green halo for shots specific to the head area - they're so realistic, it's like being in the middle of a zombie apocalypse!

The convenience of having a combination pack with 8 total targets (4 of each) is a game-changer for me. Now I don't have to worry about running out of targets or constantly replacing them. Additionally, these 12 x 18 splattering, paper targets work great with all firearms and calibers, making them a versatile option for any shooting enthusiast.

However, one small issue I've encountered is that the halo doesn't always splatter as wide as I'd like, especially if you're using smaller caliber firearms. It can make it a bit challenging to see exactly where the bullet hit, but overall, the target's performance is exceptional.

In conclusion, the Birchwood Casey Darkotic Combo Delivery Shopping targets are a must-have for anyone looking to bring some extra fun and excitement to their shooting range experience. The combination of realistic looks, easy-to-see hit indicators, and versatility make these targets an unbeatable choice.

Plus, they come in both white and green colors, so you can choose the one that best suits your preference or the environment where you'll be shooting.
