<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=swinging-targets&utm_term=ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1"><img alt="ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ridgeline-3-pack-target-set-1/public"/></a></div>

The Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set, a perfect plinking partner for those hot summer days when you just want to unleash your inner sharpshooter. I've been using this set for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer. The set includes a 1-3/4 inch rimfire rifle/pistol dual spinner target, a 3-inch rimfire rifle/pistol spinner target, a 5-inch centerfire pistol spinner target, and a 5-inch centerfire rifle gong target.

What I love most about these targets is their simplicity. They're easy to assemble, and the spinners make for a fun challenge whether you're using a rimfire firearm or a centerfire one. The targets are also quite durable, holding up against many rounds from both my. 22LR pistol and 9mm pistol.

However, one issue I've encountered is with the stability of the stands. They can be a bit wobbly, especially on hard ground or in windy conditions. I found that they work best when anchored firmly into the ground, which isn't always possible depending on where you're shooting.

Overall, the Ridgeline 3 Pack Target Set is a great addition to any shooter's collection. It's affordable, easy to set up, and most importantly, a ton of fun to use. Despite the stability issue, I'm confident these will keep me entertained for many shooting sessions to come.

As an avid handgun enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Ar500 Dueling Tree target, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my practice sessions. This larger frame target carries six 6-inch diameter steel paddles, making it a perfect dueling tree for handguns ranging from 9mm to. 45ACP. The paddles are 3/8 inch thick USA-made Ar500 steel, ensuring durability and long-lasting performance.

One of the highlights of this dueling tree is its simplicity – no springs, mechanisms, or tools required for assembly. Just snap the pieces together, and you're good to go! Additionally, it comes with a hard molded carry case for easy transportation and storage. The dimensions of this target are 48.5 inches high, 28.5 inches wide, and 23 inches deep, making it relatively compact and portable.

However, as with any product, there are a few cons to consider. Some users have reported issues with the paint coming off the paddles after use. This can be easily fixed by repainting them occasionally. Moreover, the base of the dueling tree could be sturdier, as a couple of users have mentioned that it bent after shooting at close range.

In conclusion, the Ar500 Dueling Tree target is an excellent choice for practicing your handgun skills. It offers durability, ease of assembly, and portability. Just keep in mind to use the recommended bullets to ensure the longevity of the target.

I recently picked up the SME 22 Caliber Spinner Target, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my shooting practice. As a beginner shooter, I found the spinning feature particularly helpful in improving my accuracy. The target's sturdy base and stainless steel ground spikes ensure that it stays in place even during intense shooting sessions.

One of the highlights of this target is its compatibility with soft nose lead bullets only, making it safe for use by the whole family. Another standout feature is how the target spins on a horizontal axis when struck and returns to its original position, making it incredibly engaging for shooters of all ages.

However, one con I noticed is that the target is quite small compared to other models in the market, which might be challenging for some shooters to aim at with precision. Overall, the SME 22 Caliber Spinner Target is an excellent choice for those looking for a dynamic, safe, and fun shooting target experience.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=swinging-targets&utm_term=crosman-dual-spinning-targets-2-pack-1"><img alt="crosman-dual-spinning-targets-2-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosman-dual-spinning-targets-2-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

The Crosman Dual Spinning Targets are my go-to for air gun practice sessions. I've been using them with both. 177 and. 22 caliber pellet rifles, and they never disappoint. These compact spinning targets provide the perfect level of challenge, keeping me engaged and improving my skills.

One thing that really stands out is how easy they are to transport and store. Their foldable design makes them a dream to carry around, and they take up very little space when not in use.

Although the size of these targets may seem small, it has only added to the fun for me. Every hit sends the targets spinning with that satisfying "ping! " sound. Plus, the metal frame appears to be extremely durable, giving me confidence that it can withstand countless shots without falling apart.

However, there's one issue that I've noticed - the target decals could use some improvement. They tend to wear out quite quickly, which might become a problem in the long run.

Despite this minor setback, I find the Crosman Dual Spinning Targets incredibly enjoyable and beneficial for practicing my shooting skills.

### [Magnetic Shooting Targets for Snipers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=swinging-targets&utm_term=magnetic-shooting-targets-for-snipers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/swinging-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=swinging-targets&utm_term=top-shelf-targets-sniper-magnetic-shooting-targets-8-4-pack-1"><img alt="top-shelf-targets-sniper-magnetic-shooting-targets-8-4-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/top-shelf-targets-sniper-magnetic-shooting-targets-8-4-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

Experience precision and convenience with the Top Shelf Targets Magnetic Shooting Targets. This set, featuring four high-quality targets, is designed to elevate your shooting practice to a new level.

I found the 8-inch diameter targets to be just the right size for shooting drills, providing a satisfying challenge while also maintaining enough visibility to track my shots. Whether I was practicing on my backyard hockey rink or at the local arena, these targets never failed to impress me with their performance.

However, there were a few minor inconveniences worth mentioning. Firstly, the wind can occasionally cause the targets to dislodge from the metal goal frame, requiring a quick resettling before continuing my practice. Additionally, the magnetic strength is not as strong as I would have liked, occasionally leading to accidental dislodging when players take particularly powerful shots.

Overall, I highly recommend the Top Shelf Targets Magnetic Shooting Targets for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills or add an extra layer of excitement to their practice sessions. The quality and convenience of these targets ultimately outweigh any minor flaws, making them a worthy addition to any hockey or lacrosse player's collection.

My Experience with the EZ Aim Shooting Gallery Target Shooting System Kit

I recently got my hands on the EZ Aim Shooting Gallery Target Shooting System Kit by Allen. As a shooting enthusiast, I was excited to try out this build-your-own shooting gallery kit. Upon receiving the package, I found that it included everything I needed to set up two spinning targets on a frame and two brackets for future gallery expansion.

The first thing that caught my eye was the leg kit, which broke down into convenient 16-inch sections. This made it easy to transport and store the entire system when not in use. The chain kit also included all the hardware needed for hanging gong targets, making assembly a breeze.

One major highlight was the self-healing polymer spinners used for the targets. These were extremely durable and managed to withstand countless shots without any signs of wear. The two paper target stands were another great addition, allowing me to practice my sighting and training skills without any hassle.

However, there were a few cons that came with using this system. Firstly, the lack of instructions made assembling the entire setup a bit challenging at times. Additionally, the overall stability of the system could have been better, as it tends to sway slightly during shooting sessions. Finally, the requirement of a wooden 2x4 and steel gong target meant that I had to invest more time and money into setting up the perfect shooting gallery.

In conclusion, the EZ Aim Shooting Gallery Target Shooting System Kit by Allen offers a fun and customizable way to enhance your shooting experience. While there are some minor drawbacks, the durability of the spinning targets and the ease of assembly make it worth considering for any shooting enthusiast.
