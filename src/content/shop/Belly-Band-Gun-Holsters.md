As someone who's been using this Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster for a while now, I can tell you it's a game-changer. It's versatile and comfortable, perfect for activities like walks, jogs, hikes, bike rides, and even everyday use. The 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day carrying comfort, and the breathable open-air weave keeps you cool and dry.

One of the best features is the Hard Laminate Trigger Shield. It protects your trigger from accidental discharges, ensuring safety at all times. The elastic pockets are also a standout feature. They're perfect for keeping spare mags, knives, flashlights, and pepper spray handy. The secure YKK zippered storage pockets are another bonus.

You won't believe it, but I've been using this Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster every single day, and I must say, it's been a game-changer! The holster's adjustability is just incredible because it lets me carry two firearms at once, in different configurations depending on my outfit. Plus, it's suitable for both right and left-hand draw, which is a major plus for me.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the hidden pocket. It's perfect for carrying my ID, cash, and other personal items, keeping everything in one place. And the elastic material? It's a dream come true for comfort. I forget I'm even wearing it most of the time.

However, one downside is that the Velcro quality could be better. A few users mentioned it coming loose after regular use. Additionally, some users have experienced issues with the Velcro corners hurting their skin. I'd recommend wearing the holster over a shirt to avoid this discomfort.

But overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with my Cabela's Belly Band Handgun Holster. It's practical, comfortable, and versatile - everything a gal could ask for in a holster. If you're in the market for a belly band holster, I highly recommend giving this one a shot!

One feature that truly stands out is the slide protection tab. This little detail keeps your firearm away from your skin, preventing any potential discomfort or irritation due to constant rubbing. Plus, it minimizes the chances of accidental gun discharge - a definite bonus for safety-conscious users.

Furthermore, these holster's wide elastic pockets can double up as holders for cell phones, magazines, and flashlights too! It's like having a mini utility belt on your waist. However, I did find some issues with retention while bending or twisting, indicating room for improvement in design.

Lastly, the fact that this holster is machine washable makes maintenance a breeze. Just throw it in with your regular laundry and you're good to go.

In conclusion, while the Rounded Belly Band Holster Small / Leopard certainly has some unique and useful features, some improvements could make it even better. Still, if you value convenience and safety in your everyday carry, this one might be worth considering.

I recently tried out the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65", and I must say it's a game-changer for those looking for comfortable and secure concealed carry options. The elastic construction of this belly band provides both strength and comfort, ensuring you won't feel restricted while wearing it.

One of the standout features for me was the "Sticky" material, which kept the band firmly in place without any movement or adjustments needed throughout the day. The built-in accessory pockets are also incredibly useful - they easily fit my spare magazine and folding knife, while the larger pocket accommodates my wallet, phone, and more.

Using this belly band as a travel band to discreetly store important documents has also been a lifesaver, especially when working out or going through crowded areas. The only downside I experienced was the lack of a built-in holster, but that is easily remedied by using a Sticky Holster in conjunction with the band.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65" for anyone in need of a versatile and comfortable concealed carry option that truly stands out from the competition.

I recently tried out this belly band gun holster, and I must say I've been thoroughly impressed by its performance. This holster is made of premium neoprene material, which is not only incredibly soft and comfortable but also very durable and breathable.

The highlight of the holster for me is its convenience and multifunctionality. The holster has a pistol pocket, an independent magazine clip, and an extra pocket, making it extremely easy to attach and detach your gun. Moreover, the metal buttons on the holster provide an added layer of safety by ensuring that your gun stays securely in place.

One downside I noticed with this holster was the "snap" hardware's quality or user-friendliness. It's easy to unsnap when drawing your weapon, but challenging to re-snap it back on while wearing the belly band. Another potential issue is the lack of a chafing guard to prevent the exposed part of the gun from rubbing against your belly. Lastly, some left-handed users might find the holster's design less suitable for their needs.

Despite these minor issues, I found the belly band gun holster to be an excellent value for the money. Its comfortable and breathable fabric, combined with its multi-functionality and secure hold, makes it a worthwhile option for those seeking a reliable way to carry their firearms.

The industrial strength plush elastic ensures both strength and comfort, while the sticky patches keep it securely in place.

The belly band also includes four built-in accessory pockets, making it perfect for carrying everything from an extra magazine to a wallet or phone. Plus, since there's no built-in holster, it's also great for securing items while working out or even as a travel band to hide important documents.

## Buyer's Guide

### What to Look for in a Belly Band Gun Holster

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=belly-band-gun-holsters&utm_term=belly-band-gun-holsters-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Belly+Band+Gun+Holsters-2/public" alt="Belly Band Gun Holsters-2"></a></div>

Belly band gun holsters are a versatile and comfortable option for those who carry concealed weapons regularly. When you're shopping for the best belly band gun holster for your needs, there are several features and considerations to keep in mind:

### Comfort

A good belly band holster should be comfortable enough to wear all day without causing irritation or chafing. Look for holsters made of breathable materials like neoprene or moisture-wicking fabrics. Also, consider the width of the band - thinner bands may be more comfortable, but wider bands can provide better weight distribution.

### Retention

It's crucial that your belly band holster securely holds your firearm in place. Check for adjustable retention straps and Velcro closures, which will help keep your weapon snug against your body.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/belly-band-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=belly-band-gun-holsters&utm_term=belly-band-gun-holsters-3"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Belly+Band+Gun+Holsters-3/public" alt="Belly Band Gun Holsters-3"></a></div>

### Ease of Access

In a self-defense situation, you need quick access to your firearm. Look for a belly band holster with an open-top design, which allows you to draw your weapon easily without fumbling with zippers or Velcro closures. Additionally, consider the orientation of the holster - some people prefer cross-draw or appendix carry options for faster access.

### Concealment

Belly band holsters are designed to be worn under clothing, so they should be discreet and well-hidden. Opt for darker colors that blend in with your wardrobe and consider the thickness of the holster material - thinner materials will be less noticeable under your clothing.

### Quality and Durability

Finally, invest in a high-quality belly band gun holster that's built to last. Look for strong stitching, heavy-duty Velcro closures, and robust materials like neoprene or polyester. This will ensure that your holster doesn't fall apart after a few months of regular use.
