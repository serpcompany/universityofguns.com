Made from durable AR500 steel, these targets are designed to withstand impacts from both 308 and 5. 56 rounds, making them ideal for long-range or close-range shooting.

This 12" x 24" target is made using yellow zinc-plated USA laser-cut AR500 steel, perfectly designed for static use. It features a center hole for quick and easy mounting on a 1/2” carriage bolt, making it incredibly convenient to set up and take down.

After using this product in multiple shooting sessions with various friends, I was able to thoroughly test its performance at different ranges and durability against powerful hits. Impressively, it handled shots from. 45ACP, 9mm, . 357 Magnum without any visible damage or wear. Even when bigger rounds like. 308 Winchester and. 30-06 Springfield were fired upon it, this target continued to hold strong like a champ! With such consistent quality demonstrated by the target's ability to ring out every time it was hit; I have no doubt that the AC Zone Toso will remain resilient for years of regular use on my personal range.

I have been using the 8" AR550 Gong Targets for about a month now, and they have really impressed me. The targets are made of high-quality steel, with a diameter of 8 inches each and weighing just 1. 5 pounds. They come pre-drilled for hanging chains if desired, adding an extra layer of durability while still allowing them to swing freely when struck by bullets.

The targets perform remarkably well in various weather conditions and show no signs of wear even after countless rounds from my. 308 rifle. Another noteworthy aspect is the exceptional sound feedback they provide; whenever hit, these gongs produce an incredibly satisfying "ping" sound that can be heard echoing across my property.

Setting up the targets is quick and easy thanks to their simple design and inclusion of T-post holders. I appreciate how attention has been paid to safety during manufacturing - they are built tough enough to handle repeated impacts from high-powered firearms without any issues whatsoever, unlike some cheaper plasma cut targets which can have weak spots resulting from heat affected zones in their construction process. I also like that the description mentions recommended distances for shooting – at least 200 yards for large caliber rifles and 10 yards for pistols.

My experience with these AR550 Gong Targets has been nothing short of fantastic, as both a seasoned marksman and someone who enjoys backyard target practice recreationally on occasion. If you’re looking for reliable steel targets that offer excellent durability, great sound feedback on hit confirmations & can handle heavy use over time then look no further than these!

The Caldwell AR500 Gong Target has been an exceptional addition to my shooting practice routine. Constructed from high-quality AR500 hardened steel, this 8-inch target is incredibly durable and capable of withstanding long hours of use.

What I appreciate most about this product is its versatility - it's available in seven different sizes, each with three hanging solutions. This provides shooters the freedom to choose a target that best suits their needs and preferences.

The AR500 Gong Target performs remarkably well, even at high velocities (up to 3000 fps) and energies (up to 3500 ft-lb). During my practice sessions, the target consistently held up against repeated rounds without any damage or wear. The yellow color of the target also makes it highly visible from a distance, making it great for accuracy shots or friendly competitions with friends.

Although there may be other similar products on the market, I believe that Caldwell offers better value due to its quality construction and extensive customization options. Furthermore, the target's ability to hold up against thousands of rounds without issue makes it a more reliable choice for serious shooters. While some might argue that other targets have comparable durability or design features, I stand by my recommendation of the Caldwell AR500 Gong Target as a top choice for anyone looking for an efficient and reliable shooting practice accessory.

I appreciate the clear ringing sound upon impact which offers instant feedback on my shots, enhancing my overall shooting accuracy.

Compared to other similar products, this target is competitively priced, and the fact that it doesn't have a powder coat saves money without compromising its performance.

Constructed from thick AR500 steel, this target can withstand continuous use without showing damage signs.

The two carriage bolt holes allow easy hanging during practice sessions, and its weight of 36. 5 lbs ensures stability when shot from various angles. One of my favorite features is the deep "gong" sound that indicates an accurate hit, helping to hone your aim correctly!

However, compared to other targets on the market, this one is quite expensive. Nevertheless, given its solid construction and durability over time, it's worth investing in if you take pest control seriously.

The 1/2" AR 500 Steel Armor Plate Target is a fantastic option for those looking to spice up their shooting practice. Its precision-cut holes make hanging it up effortlessly, while its raw steel construction ensures durability even with constant fire. One standout feature is its manufacturing process, which involves cutting with a CNC High Definition plasma cutter for precise edges and shapes, resulting in an impressive end product that can withstand powerful ammunition without visible wear.

Additionally, the target offers multiple hanging options – through chains, bolts, clevises, cable or rope - making setup easy and customizable. However, if left unused for extended periods outside the elements, surface rust may develop due to raw steel. A fresh coat of spray paint should keep it new-looking for years.

Overall, this target is a great investment for enhancing shooting skills or having fun on range days with friends and family.

This immediate feedback helps shooters identify weaknesses and areas for improvement in their shooting technique.

### What is the difference between AR500 and AR450 steel targets?

AR500 Steel Targets are generally thicker (1/4-inch to 1/2-inch) and more durable than AR450 Steel Targets, which are typically 1/4-inch thick. This added thickness allows AR500 steel targets to withstand more impacts and last longer, making them a more cost-effective choice for heavy use.
