<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1"><img alt="hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1/public"/></a></div>

In my quest for the perfect western-style leather shoulder rig gun holster, I came across the Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster 44/45 Caliber Black. Now a devoted fan, I'm excited to share my experience with this must-have accessory.

To begin with, the intricate hand tooling and hand-carved traditional designs on this holster are nothing short of exceptional. The level of craftsmanship is evident in every detail, from the unbreakable metal core casing to the adjustable hammer loop.

One of my favorite features is the leather leg tie, which not only enhances durability but also adds an extra layer of comfort. The leg flap behind the holster is yet another practical touch that sets this product apart from others.

As for the gun belt itself, it's designed to hold about 16-52 rounds of ammo, making it incredibly versatile and suitable for various needs. The full-grain American Cowhide leather harness ensures durability and longevity, while the consistent vegetable drum dye coloring adds a touch of sophistication.

Finding the right size can be a challenge, but ordering 4 to 6 inches larger than your pants size should do the trick. The belt has about 5 holes all an inch apart, so you can adjust it as needed for a comfortable fit.

In terms of barrel length compatibility, this holster is designed to fit most barrel lengths ranging from 4 to 8 inches, making it an excellent choice for a wide variety of firearms.

Overall, I can't recommend the Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster enough. The combination of expert craftsmanship, practical features, and stylish design make it the ultimate accessory for any western gun enthusiast.

### [Air Gun Holster - Photon for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=air-gun-holster-photon-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Photon Glock 17 Holster from Alien Gear for my everyday carry (EDC) needs. As a fan of their holsters, I was excited to try this new one out. The photon is truly standout due to its modular design – it can be used as both an outside the waistband (OWB) and inside the waistband (IWB) holster, making it versatile for different occasions.

One of the key features that impresses me is the inclusion of an appendix carry wing for concealment. This not only adds extra concealment but also allows me to comfortably carry my Glock without it digging into my skin. It's also great to see that this holster is compatible with compact lights and has an optic cut for any optics except the SRO, showcasing Alien Gear's commitment to catering to modern shooters.

However, there are a few things I would have liked to see differently. The attachment style, which includes a belt clip and paddle, is quite bulky. This made attaching the holster to my belt a bit cumbersome as the claw tends to catch on my pants when trying to clip quickly. I didn't expect such an inconvenience from a well-known brand like Alien Gear.

Overall, the Photon Glock 17 Holster has been a decent addition to my EDC gear. Its modular design is definitely a highlight, but the bulky attachment style could use some improvement for a smoother experience. For anyone looking for a versatile, albeit slightly flawed, holster, this might be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 W Light Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-p320cm18-w-light-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon holster and I've been using it with my P320C/M18 light-bearing handgun. The first thing that caught my attention was its sleek, modern design. It's made of polymer, which gives it a solid feel without adding unnecessary weight.

One of the highlights for me is its ambidextrous configuration. Whether I'm wearing it as an inside-the-waistband (IWB) or outside-the-waistband (OWB), this holster adapts seamlessly. It's optimized for appendix carry, which is my preferred method of concealed carry, and it even comes with an appendix carry wing for extra concealment.

Another feature that I appreciate is the holster's compatibility with compact lights. As someone who often trains in low-light conditions, this is a must-have feature for me. Additionally, the optic cut accommodates most optics except for the SRO, making it versatile for various gun setups.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The belt clips and hardware were missing from my package, making the holster unusable until I can get those components. Additionally, the retention is quite tight even when the screws are loosened. This can make drawing the firearm more challenging than I'd like.

Despite these cons, I'm overall pleased with the Alien Gear Photon holster. Its build quality is impressive, and its versatility and adaptability make it a useful addition to my collection of concealed carry holsters.

### [Brown Leather Western Holster for 32-44 Waist Sizes](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steampunk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=steampunk-gun-holsters&utm_term=brown-leather-western-holster-for-32-44-waist-sizes)

I recently purchased the Denix Old West Leather Holster DX704 for my 1873 non-firing replica pistols, and I must say, it has been a great addition to my collection. The leather construction gives it a sturdy feel, making it perfect for carrying your replica pistol securely. I particularly love the tooled detailing on the holster, which adds to its overall aesthetic appeal.

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable waist size, fitting waists from 32" to 44". As someone who has struggled with finding holsters that fit comfortably, this was a breath of fresh air. The replica bullets included in the package are an added bonus, allowing me to complete the authentic Western look.

However, there's one thing that could be improved upon: the sizing chart provided by the manufacturer. It's a little bit confusing, so I advise potential buyers to reach out to their customer support team for clarification before making their purchase.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Denix Old West Leather Holster DX704. It's perfect for anyone looking to add a touch of Western charm to their outfit or replica pistol collection. Highly recommended!
