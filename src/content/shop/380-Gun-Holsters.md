<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/380-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=380-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381"><img alt="desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381/public"/></a></div>

I recently decided to upgrade my EDC carry with the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Sig P365. From the moment I put it on, I knew I made the right choice. The combination of top grain saddle leather and a PU coating makes it not only incredibly comfortable but also extremely durable. This puppy was built with longevity and performance as primary concerns, and it shows.

The smooth leather lining is a huge plus too. It not only protects my gun's finish but also offers a quick and silky draw. The Die Hard Ankle Rig features a tough leather lined holster with a conventional thumb break that's been attached to a neoprene leg band. The leg band is padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, making it feel like a second skin on my calf.

One thing I've noticed when wearing this ankle rig is how confidently I can carry it. The neoprene leg band and calf strap do an excellent job of keeping it secure and in place. Plus, the fact that it's both handsome and comfortable is just icing on the cake.

Of course, no product is perfect. One minor issue I've encountered is that the overall set up can be slightly wider than expected, leading to a bit of 'printing' when wearing certain types of pants. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such an excellent ankle rig.

All in all, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig is my new go-to for concealed carry. It's comfortable, secure, and built like a tank. If you're in the market for an ankle holster, look no further – this bad boy will get the job done and then some.

I recently got my hands on the Vedder Holsters Ruger LCP Max. 380 Pocket Locker and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who prefers concealed carry without the need for a waistline holster, this little beauty has become my go-to. The three different ways to draw are impressive - whether you're drawing from your pocket, attaching it to your purse or bag, or using the optional thumb tab for quick release.

One thing that really stood out to me was the custom molding of the Kydex material to fit my unique gun model perfectly. It's so secure and comfortable that I don't even notice it's there, which is exactly what you want in a holster. Plus, the full sweat guard ensures that no moisture from my body comes in contact with my pistol, keeping it in pristine condition.

However, one minor downside I've encountered is that the magazine release isn't covered, which could potentially lead to accidental release while carrying. But so far, I haven't experienced any issues with this. Overall, I would highly recommend the Ruger LCP Max. 380 Pocket Locker Holster for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and customizable pocket holster.
