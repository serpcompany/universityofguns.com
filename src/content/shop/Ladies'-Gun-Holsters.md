<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who loves to carry my Byrna for self-defense, having a comfortable holster that allows me to do so both inside and outside the waistband is a huge plus.

What really stood out to me about this holster is its minimalist design. It's lightweight and slim, making it easy to forget I'm wearing it until I need to access my Byrna. The open-muzzle bottom gives me plenty of room to grab my launcher quickly and securely, which is essential in a self-defense situation.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this holster. Some users have mentioned that it can be difficult to re-holster the launcher, especially after a few uses. Additionally, the magazine release button on some models may stick out too far, causing the magazine to be ejected inadvertently.

Overall, I've been very satisfied with my Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster. Its comfortable design and versatile carry options make it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their Byrna with ease and confidence.

### [Air Gun Holster - Photon for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Photon Glock 17 Holster from Alien Gear for my everyday carry (EDC) needs. As a fan of their holsters, I was excited to try this new one out. The photon is truly standout due to its modular design – it can be used as both an outside the waistband (OWB) and inside the waistband (IWB) holster, making it versatile for different occasions.

One of the key features that impresses me is the inclusion of an appendix carry wing for concealment. This not only adds extra concealment but also allows me to comfortably carry my Glock without it digging into my skin. It's also great to see that this holster is compatible with compact lights and has an optic cut for any optics except the SRO, showcasing Alien Gear's commitment to catering to modern shooters.

However, there are a few things I would have liked to see differently. The attachment style, which includes a belt clip and paddle, is quite bulky. This made attaching the holster to my belt a bit cumbersome as the claw tends to catch on my pants when trying to clip quickly. I didn't expect such an inconvenience from a well-known brand like Alien Gear.

Overall, the Photon Glock 17 Holster has been a decent addition to my EDC gear. Its modular design is definitely a highlight, but the bulky attachment style could use some improvement for a smoother experience. For anyone looking for a versatile, albeit slightly flawed, holster, this might be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

### [Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for Ruger LCP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ladies-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster, specifically designed for the Ruger LCP. To be honest, I was hesitant at first because I've had holsters that didn't fit well or felt uncomfortable. But this one pleasantly surprised me.

First off, it's made incredibly light and tough, making it very comfortable to wear. It also has a secure belt-mount mechanism that ensures my gun stays put. The holster gets its durability from 600-denier nylon, which offers four layers of protection including a brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed-cell foam.

Now, while I've had no issues with the holster being loose or floppy, some reviewers did mention that. However, this might be due to individual differences or the type of gun being carried.

One feature that I found incredibly convenient is the adjustability. The straps are fully adjustable and connect with velcro to the holster. These adjustments allow for a snug fit, making me feel secure when carrying my Ruger LCP.

Despite these positives, I did encounter one problem. The straps can be a bit difficult to adjust, especially when trying to slide one side of the Velcro strap through a tight opening. This could potentially lead to damaging the holster if not done carefully.

All in all, I've been quite satisfied with the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster. It's light, tough, and secure, and its adjustability has ensured a comfortable fit for me. The adjustment issue can be a bit frustrating, but this seems to be a one-off problem and not representative of the holster's overall quality.
