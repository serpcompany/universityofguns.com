<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/5-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=5-gun-safes&utm_term=american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet, and I must say, I'm quite impressed by its design and features. This compact cabinet is perfect for securing my long guns, and it definitely adds a sense of security to my home.

One of the standout features of this cabinet is its three-point locking system. It provides that extra layer of security that I was looking for. Additionally, the high-quality black powder-coated paint gives it a sleek and attractive finish.

Another aspect that I really like about this product is its soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor. This ensures that my firearms stay safe and intact, even during those tumultuous times when you might need to quickly retrieve them.

One downside to this cabinet, however, is its assembly. It comes fully assembled, which is a great feature for convenience, but it's not the sturdiest. There have been a few instances where the seams have come undone, causing some concern about the overall durability of the cabinet.

Despite this minor issue, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet has been a great addition to my home. It provides peace of mind and ensures that my firearms are kept in a secure and organized space.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/5-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=5-gun-safes&utm_term=vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1"><img alt="vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1/public"/></a></div>

My journey with the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe has been quite eventful. As a first-time gun owner, I was initially excited about the prospect of owning a solid gun cabinet that not only secures my beloved firearms, but also offers a space for document and paperwork storage. However, this excitement was short-lived as the cabinet's material was thin and flimsy, making it difficult to maintain its upright position without additional support, which wasn't great for a cabinet designed for heavy-duty firearms.

Nevertheless, the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe did shine in certain areas. The digital keypad allowed for quick access and the cabinet's interior was well-lit, making it easy to locate specific items in low-light conditions. It also came with a removable shelf, allowing for customizable storage configurations based on my needs.

Despite providing decent basic security, the cabinet didn't offer much room for document storage, which turned out to be a major downside. In addition, the cabinet's quality fell short of my expectations, leaving much to be desired in terms of durability and overall build quality.

Overall, while the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe offered some useful features, it was a lackluster experience due to its low-quality material and limited storage capabilities. However, for gun enthusiasts on a budget who prioritize basic firearm security, this cabinet may be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/5-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=5-gun-safes&utm_term=snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1"><img alt="snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Snapsafe 75011 Super Titan Modular Gun Safe, and I have to say, it's quite a unique piece of equipment. As someone who's always on the lookout for innovative solutions to everyday problems, the Super Titan caught my eye with its modular assembly system.

First off, let me tell you about the assembly process. It really did live up to its promise of being quick and easy. I was able to assemble the entire safe in just about an hour, with only a wrench that was included in the package. I didn't need any other tools, which saved me a lot of time and effort.

The Snapsafe is quite sturdy, thanks to its thick 9 gauge steel exterior walls. The 3/16" solid steel door is also quite impressive, offering resistance against sledgehammers and pry-bars. This level of protection is what you'd expect from a high-end safe, so it was definitely a pleasant surprise to find it in this product.

I was also quite impressed with the UL Listing for its 1-hour fire rating. This means that the safe can withstand up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour, providing ample protection for your valuable possessions.

However, there were a couple of things that left me feeling a bit underwhelmed about the Super Titan. The lock mechanism, for one, felt a bit cheap and delicate compared to other safes I've used in the past. Additionally, I couldn't find any stickers or certifications indicating that the safe had undergone proper testing for its fire rating.

Overall, I think the Snapsafe 75011 Super Titan Modular Gun Safe is a decent option for those looking for a modular and sturdy safe. It's not perfect, but it does offer some unique benefits that set it apart from other options on the market. If you can overlook its minor flaws, it's definitely worth considering for your personal safety needs.

### [30-Minute Fireproof Instinct Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/5-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=5-gun-safes&utm_term=30-minute-fireproof-instinct-gun-safe)

As a frequent user of the Sports Afield SA5525INS Instinct Gun Safe, I can say it has made my life so much easier. Right from the get-go, I was impressed by its sturdy construction and sleek matte black exterior. The safe was a breeze to set up, with its fully programmable electronic lock and user-friendly software.

One of the standout features of this safe is its adjustable polymer barrel racks and included scoped rifle standoffs. This allowed me to customize the storage solution to fit my specific needs, accommodating a variety of long guns and even some of my smaller handguns.

The Instinct Gun Safe also boasts some impressive fire-resisting capabilities. With a 30-minute rating at 1400 degrees Fahrenheit and California DOJ approval, I feel confident that my firearms are secure and protected from both theft and potential fires.

While I have had a mostly positive experience with this safe, there are a few small hiccups worth mentioning. The safe did come with a bit of an odd smell when first opened, but this dissipated over time. Additionally, one of the two fail-safe override keys included was non-functional, which I hope will be rectified in future models.

In conclusion, the Sports Afield SA5525INS Instinct Gun Safe is a reliable and customizable storage solution for those looking to keep their firearms secure and organized. With its rugged steel construction, adjustable storage options, and impressive fire-resisting capabilities, I have no hesitation in recommending this safe to fellow gun enthusiasts.

One feature that stood out to me was the 4" wide, 3/16" thick military-style locking bars that make it nearly impossible for thieves to gain access. The safe also boasts an incredible 68,000-BTU fire-resistance rating, meaning it can withstand temperatures of up to 1,200°F for 40 minutes – enough time for emergency responders to arrive should a fire occur.

Despite its robust features, the safe is surprisingly easy to operate thanks to its electronic lock system. All in all, the Cabela's Outfitter Gun Safe is a reliable and secure solution for those looking to protect their valuable items.

However, there is room for improvement. There were times when I struggled with the electronic lock system, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. If it weren't for this minor inconvenience, I would give this safe a perfect score.

Overall, I highly recommend the Cabela's Outfitter Gun Safe by Liberty to anyone in need of secure storage for their firearms and other priceless possessions.

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet in black, and I have to say, it's been a game changer for me. I had been looking for a safe and secure way to store my long guns and handguns, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy, high-end safe. That's where this little cabinet came in.

The first thing that caught my eye was the two separate compartments. I could fit five long guns in the bottom compartment and have a separate section for my handguns and ammunition up top. The three-point locking system gave me an added sense of security, knowing that my firearms were protected against unauthorized access.

Once I got the cabinet home and assembled, I was impressed with the quality of the materials. The powder-coated steel was sturdy, and the soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor added an extra layer of protection for my guns. I also appreciated the fact that the cabinet came fully assembled, so all I had to do was mount it to the wall – no complicated assembly required.

However, there were a few downsides to this cabinet as well. The main issue was that it wasn't very heavy or sturdy, which made me worry that a determined thief might be able to carry it away if they gained access to my home. Additionally, I noticed that the paint chipped off in a few spots, which was a little disappointing considering the quality of the materials.

Overall, I would highly recommend the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to anyone looking for a secure and affordable way to store their firearms. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done and provides peace of mind, knowing that my guns are safe and protected.
