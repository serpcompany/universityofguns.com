I recently purchased the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. After using it for several months, I have noticed some positive aspects as well as a few areas where it could improve.

One great feature of this gun safe is the key-coded cylinder lock and 4-way door locking, providing me with a sense of security when I'm away from my guns. The molded barrel rests and foam-padded bottom also help protect my antique firearms from any dings or scratches. These features make the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe stand out in terms of protection for your weapons.
