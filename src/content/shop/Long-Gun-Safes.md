<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. After using it for several months, I have noticed some positive aspects as well as a few areas where it could improve.

One great feature of this gun safe is the key-coded cylinder lock and 4-way door locking, providing me with a sense of security when I'm away from my guns. The molded barrel rests and foam-padded bottom also help protect my antique firearms from any dings or scratches. These features make the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe stand out in terms of protection for your weapons.

However, there are a couple of issues that I have encountered during use. The instructions provided were low in quality, making assembly a bit challenging. Additionally, some users have reported durability issues with certain parts such as hinges and door latches, which can cause concern when relying on this product to protect your valuables over time.

Overall, the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe does provide basic protection for your firearms with its sturdy structure and multiple locks. However, if you're looking for something more heavy-duty or long lasting in terms of construction quality, this might not be the ideal option for you.

### [Cannon 20+4 Gun Fire-Resistant Safe: Ultimate Protection for Your Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-204-gun-fire-resistant-safe-ultimate-protection-for-your-valuables)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24"><img alt="cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24/public"/></a></div>

My experience with the Cannon TS5722 20+4 gun fire-resistant safe has been excellent. I was impressed with the interior luxury, which includes soft materials to prevent scratches, and the adjustable shelving system made organizing my valuables a breeze. The factory-installed door organization kit holds up my pistols securely, providing extra peace of mind.

The heavy-duty construction is another standout feature - it includes a solid steel unibody design, three 1" diameter steel live-action locking bolts, and TruLock internal hinge system that prevents pry attacks. This adds to my confidence in the product's ability to protect my belongings from potential thieves or fires.

Although storage capacity is ample for essential items like documents or jewelry along with weapons, fitting the maximum advertised number of firearms might be challenging due to space constraints. The electronic lock comes with a backup key for emergencies; however, some users have reported occasional difficulty getting all long guns inside without crowding them together and a relatively small interior depth.

Despite these minor issues, this safe provides great value for money considering its high-quality build combined with security features such as Triple Fin seal protection against drill attacks – making it perfect not only for those looking to protect their valuables but also those seeking a reliable solution to store their firearm collection safely away from children's reach while remaining easily accessible when needed most!

### [Cannon 48 Long Gun + 6 Handgun Safe with E-Lock and 45 Minute Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-safe-with-e-lock-and-45-minute-fire-rating)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon TS5934 Gun Safe and have been using it for the past month. Assembly was a bit challenging, so I enlisted some help due to its weight. The size is perfect for my storage needs, as it accommodates 48 long guns and 6 handguns comfortably. The door organization is a nice touch, providing ample space for smaller items. The carpeted interior with black leatherette trim ensures that my valuables are protected from scratches and damage.

The electronic lock and keypad work seamlessly, giving me peace of mind about accessing my safe's content when needed. However, I have concerns about the quality of some components such as the plastic shelf retainer clips which seem flimsy and could potentially break easily over time. Additionally, while the safe is fire-rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, there isn't enough information available on its fire resistance capabilities to give me complete confidence in its ability to protect my belongings in case of a fire.

Overall, this product meets most of my expectations in terms of securing my firearms and other valuable items. Despite minor concerns about component quality and fire resistance information, it serves its purpose well in keeping my possessions safe from potential threats such as thieves or fires.

I recently purchased the Preserve SA5940P-BIO 20. 55 cu. ft. Fireproof and Waterproof 40-Gun Safe with Biometric Lock for my home, as security is of utmost importance to me. This safe impressed me right from the moment it was delivered, with its industrial-grade steel construction and robust Uni-Weld body. The biometric lock allowed for easy programming of up to 100 unique fingerprints, providing both convenience and extra layer of security when accessing the contents inside.

What truly stood out to me was the Triple Seal technology, which forms a protective barrier against fire, water, and smoke damage. This feature brought immense peace of mind knowing that my valuables would remain safe in case of any unforeseen accidents or emergencies. The eight 1. 5-inch steel locking bolts on the door provide additional strength against break-in attempts or tampering, making this safe an excellent investment for any homeowner seeking reliable security.

The interior design is equally impressive, featuring a fully carpeted interior with a carpeted barrel rest for up to 40 guns positions, a Zero-Sag steel reinforced top shelf as well as three height adjustable/removable side shelves for flexible storage arrangement - perfect for organizing everything inside!

Overall, choosing this Preserve gun safe has exceeded my expectations by offering not only top-notch safety features but also user friendly aspects such as multiple entry options (biometric scanning or Fail Safe override keys). With high quality construction and thoughtful design elements throughout both inside and outside; this product has been an exceptional choice in keeping our home secure!

### [High-Capacity 5 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=high-capacity-5-gun-safe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/public"/></a></div>

Man, I've been using this 5 Gun Safe from American Furniture Classics for quite some time now. I've got to say, it's been a real game-changer in securing my firearms. The 3-directional bolt system along with the soft foam pad at the bottom has proved to be a real lifesaver when it comes to keeping my valuables safely stowed away.

One of the standout features for me has been the high strength steel construction. This thing is an absolute beast, providing me with an unmatched level of security. It's also got holes for mounting to the wall and floor, which gives me peace of mind knowing that it's going nowhere.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The keyed access can be a bit of a pain at times, especially when you're in a hurry. And while the high-strength steel is fantastic, the thing is quite heavy, making it a bit of a challenge to move around.

Overall, I've been quite happy with my purchase. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly done a great job of keeping my firearms safe and secure. So if you're in the market for a gun safe, this one's definitely worth considering.

One downside to this cabinet, however, is its assembly. It comes fully assembled, which is a great feature for convenience, but it's not the sturdiest. There have been a few instances where the seams have come undone, causing some concern about the overall durability of the cabinet.

So whether you're preparing for the zombie apocalypse, or just looking to keep your family heirlooms safe, this sturdy and feature-rich safe will be your faithful ally.

### [Cabela's Signature 64-Gun Safe with Mechanical Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-gun-safes&utm_term=cabelas-signature-64-gun-safe-with-mechanical-lock)

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet in black, and I have to say, it's been a game changer for me. I had been looking for a safe and secure way to store my long guns and handguns, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy, high-end safe. That's where this little cabinet came in.

The three-point locking system gave me an added sense of security, knowing that my firearms were protected against unauthorized access.

Once I got the cabinet home and assembled, I was impressed with the quality of the materials. The powder-coated steel was sturdy, and the soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor added an extra layer of protection for my guns. I also appreciated the fact that the cabinet came fully assembled, so all I had to do was mount it to the wall – no complicated assembly required.

However, there were a few downsides to this cabinet as well. The main issue was that it wasn't very heavy or sturdy, which made me worry that a determined thief might be able to carry it away if they gained access to my home. Additionally, I noticed that the paint chipped off in a few spots, which was a little disappointing considering the quality of the materials.

Overall, I would highly recommend the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to anyone looking for a secure and affordable way to store their firearms. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done and provides peace of mind, knowing that my guns are safe and protected.
