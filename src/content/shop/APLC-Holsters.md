One standout feature is the easy on/easy off belt clip - it securely attaches to belts up to 1. 5" wide and can be removed with ease when needed. Additionally, the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard provide tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is safely secured at all times. Although there are no adjustments needed for built-in retention, which could be a drawback for some users who prefer customization options, I find this aspect convenient and hassle-free.

One of the best features is the high sweat guard which keeps my firearm off my body, preventing moisture and slide serration discomfort. Plus, the belt clip is fantastic; it holds my holster securely in place on my belt until I need it.

The built-in retention ensures that my firearm stays secure at all times while giving me peace of mind and tactile feedback when removing the weapon from the holster. The entire holster is one piece, so attaching it to any belt is a breeze ‚Äì you just clip it on and go!

Comfort-wise, this holster excels with its smooth edges and full-length sweat shield. I can easily wear it all day long without any issues whatsoever while doing physical activities like hiking or running errands around town ‚Äì no pain points! üòÉ

My only minor complaint would be adjusting the cant can be tricky sometimes; an adjustable cant option would be great to have for added convenience. However, overall this is a fantastic carrying option that's well worth considering if you own a Sig P320C / M18 like myself! üëç

I recently purchased the BladeTech Signature OWB Holster due to its affordability and positive reviews. After using it for a few months, I must say that I am quite impressed with its durability, fit, and versatility.

A feature that stands out is the adjustable retention, which allows me to tighten or loosen the holster's grip on my firearm. Also, the precise molding ensures that my gun fits securely and snugly in all sorts of tactical positions. Additionally, swapping between belt attachments and MOLLE panels is effortless for added versatility.

Although there are some minor downsides, such as releasing from paddle mounts being tricky at times due to their flatness on wider belts, this doesn't overshadow the holster's overall quality. Overall, I highly recommend purchasing a BladeTech Signature OWB Holster for an exceptional yet budget-friendly solution with excellent design and construction elements.

### [ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster for Right-Hand Draw](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/aplc-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

After using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster for several weeks, I have found it to be a great concealed carry option. The design allows for smooth and fast draws while keeping your firearm securely in place. One of the notable features is its versatility; it comes in three sizes that cater to different body types, and can be worn in various positions according to personal preferences. The built-in pocket is also handy, providing extra space to carry magazines or small essentials like keys or ID cards.

The breathable neoprene band is comfortable to wear even during hot days, which is a big plus for warm climate dwellers. However, larger weapons can make the holster uncomfortable as they press against the body more noticeably than smaller ones do. Also, this holster doesn't offer much storage space besides an extra magazine or two, so if you need additional storage capacity, this might not be the best choice for you.

In conclusion, I am pleased with my experience using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster due to its easy accessibility and discretion combined with convenience. It may have some minor downsides but overall it's a solid product worth trying out!
