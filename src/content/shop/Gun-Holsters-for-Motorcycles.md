<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1"><img alt="desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the DeSantis VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk holster for quite some time now, and it's been quite the game-changer. This outside waistband (OWB) holster is specifically designed for the Springfield Armory Hellcat, and it's been a perfect fit. The black color is sleek and adds a subtle touch to my everyday attire.

One of the things that stood out for me with this holster is its ability to be easily accessed in an emergency. The OWB design is super convenient and quick when it comes to retrieving my Hellcat. The high-quality materials used in its construction are durable and make me feel confident in its long-term use.

In terms of comfort, the VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk has been a dream. Its slim design makes it incredibly comfortable to wear all day without sacrificing concealment. I appreciate how the adjustable cant and tension allow me to customize the fit and draw speed to my preference.

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a few minor cons. The retention system can be a bit stiff initially, but it loosens up over time. Additionally, while the holster is suitable for right-handed users, left-handed shooters might not find it as practical.

All in all, I would highly recommend the DeSantis VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable holster for their Springfield Armory Hellcat. Its unique design and solid retention make it a top choice in the market.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Photon Glock 17 Holster from Alien Gear for my everyday carry (EDC) needs. As a fan of their holsters, I was excited to try this new one out. The photon is truly standout due to its modular design – it can be used as both an outside the waistband (OWB) and inside the waistband (IWB) holster, making it versatile for different occasions.

One of the key features that impresses me is the inclusion of an appendix carry wing for concealment. This not only adds extra concealment but also allows me to comfortably carry my Glock without it digging into my skin. It's also great to see that this holster is compatible with compact lights and has an optic cut for any optics except the SRO, showcasing Alien Gear's commitment to catering to modern shooters.

However, there are a few things I would have liked to see differently. The attachment style, which includes a belt clip and paddle, is quite bulky. This made attaching the holster to my belt a bit cumbersome as the claw tends to catch on my pants when trying to clip quickly. I didn't expect such an inconvenience from a well-known brand like Alien Gear.

Overall, the Photon Glock 17 Holster has been a decent addition to my EDC gear. Its modular design is definitely a highlight, but the bulky attachment style could use some improvement for a smoother experience. For anyone looking for a versatile, albeit slightly flawed, holster, this might be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-48-48mos-holster-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-48-48mos-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-48-48mos-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got myself an Alien Gear Photon Holster for my Glock 48, and I've been really happy with its performance. The polymer construction and the sleek black finish make it look modern and stylish. One of the things that stood out to me was its adaptability - it can be worn either inside or outside the waistband, making it suitable for a variety of occasions.

The holster is optimized for appendix carry, which is great for concealment. I also appreciate the included appendix carry wing that further helps with concealment and provides some flexibility in how I can carry my weapon. The compatibility with compact lights and the option for an optic cut are also features that cater to the modern shooter's needs. Plus, knowing that it's made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty gives me peace of mind.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. Some users might find it bulkier than other holsters on the market. The clip and claw combo can be a bit challenging to attach to the belt, especially during initial use. Additionally, while the modularity is appealing, some users might find that other holsters offer more comfort and concealment as their skills and knowledge improve.

Overall, I would recommend the Alien Gear Photon Holster for its versatility, adaptability, and sleek design. While there are some minor issues to consider, the features it offers more than make up for them. It's definitely worth checking out for anyone in the market for a new holster.

### [Ambidextrous IWB Mossberg MC2C Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=ambidextrous-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Desantis Gunhole Slim-TUK IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous, and I must say, it's an interesting piece of equipment. The minimalistic design appealed to me initially, but what really stands out is the adjustable tension and rugged 1.75-inch nylon clip that comes with it.

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the tuck-able 360 C-clip, as it provides me with numerous mounting options, making it versatile in various situations. Another notable thing about this IWB holster is the hardware that can be easily flipped to change from right to left-hand orientation for ambidextrous usage.

However, there are certain downsides too. It lacks a certain level of fit for my Mossberg MC2C, which could be a significant issue. Furthermore, the design isn't perfect; the gap between the barrel and the end of the holster is somewhat frustrating.

Overall, this holster offers some unique benefits but also has its limitations. It could be a good choice for those looking for a minimalistic and versatile IWB holster, but I would recommend trying it out with your gun first before making a purchase decision.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-motorcycles?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=gun-holsters-for-motorcycles&utm_term=seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.
