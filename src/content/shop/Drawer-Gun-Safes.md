### [VEVOR 5 Gun Cabinet with Lock and Digital Keypad](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/drawer-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1/public"/></a></div>

My journey with the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe has been quite eventful. As a first-time gun owner, I was initially excited about the prospect of owning a solid gun cabinet that not only secures my beloved firearms, but also offers a space for document and paperwork storage. However, this excitement was short-lived as the cabinet's material was thin and flimsy, making it difficult to maintain its upright position without additional support, which wasn't great for a cabinet designed for heavy-duty firearms.

Nevertheless, the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe did shine in certain areas. The digital keypad allowed for quick access and the cabinet's interior was well-lit, making it easy to locate specific items in low-light conditions. It also came with a removable shelf, allowing for customizable storage configurations based on my needs.

Despite providing decent basic security, the cabinet didn't offer much room for document storage, which turned out to be a major downside. In addition, the cabinet's quality fell short of my expectations, leaving much to be desired in terms of durability and overall build quality.

Overall, while the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe offered some useful features, it was a lackluster experience due to its low-quality material and limited storage capabilities. However, for gun enthusiasts on a budget who prioritize basic firearm security, this cabinet may be worth considering.

I recently decided to upgrade my home security by getting the Stalwart Biometric Desk Mount Gun Safe. I've always been a little forgetful, so I love how it offers quick access with just my fingerprint or key.

The construction is impressive - made from powder-coated 14-gauge carbon steel, it's solid as a rock and resistant to pry attempts. And let's not forget about the anti-impact latches, bolstered interior hinges, and alarm system that alerts me if the safe gets bumped.

There are some minor drawbacks though. It's kind of bulky, which made it a tight fit in my desk drawer. Also, the fingerprint sensor occasionally has trouble recognizing my print, but this seems more like user error than product fault.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this Biometric Desk Mount Gun Safe. It gives me peace of mind knowing my handguns are secure yet easily accessible when I need them most.

The ability to program it for up to 32 users is a plus too, making it perfect for sharing with family or friends.

Additionally, the foam-padded interior added an extra layer of protection, ensuring that my valued items remain in pristine condition. Setting up the safe was a breeze thanks to the pre-drilled mounting holes and the included mounting hardware. Plus, having backup keys and extra batteries provided me with peace of mind in case of emergencies.

One minor inconvenience I encountered was the absence of adjustable shelves, limiting my storage options slightly. However, considering its purpose and price point, I believe the benefits far outweigh this minor inconvenience. In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and affordable drawer safe to protect your valuables, the Fortress drawer safe model 44E10 is definitely worth a try.

The deluxe quick-access firearm safe comes with a 4-pistol foam rack, making it easy to store and organize your handguns.

One of the best features is the gas strut, which automatically opens the door quickly and quietly. This allows for quick access to your firearms without creating any unwanted noise. The interior lighting is another great addition, providing increased visibility so you can easily access your guns even in low light conditions.

Another highlight is the pre-drilled anchor points and top opening that enable you to secure the safe to the floor or a large drawer. This ensures that your handguns are not only protected but also well-hidden from potential thieves. Additionally, the triple access option (key, code, and fingerprint reader) offers flexibility and convenience, allowing you to choose the most suitable method for accessing your firearms.
