I recently had the opportunity to use the Orange Silhouette Cut Off Below Ring 7 target from Action Target, and I was pleasantly surprised at its quality. The bright orange color and distinct silhouette shape made it easy to aim at from a distance, which is essential for my shooting practice.

### [Winnwell 52" Reinforced Long Range Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-range-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-range-targets&utm_term=winnwell-52-reinforced-long-range-target)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/long-range-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=long-range-targets&utm_term=winnwell-52in-heavy-duty-shooting-target-1"><img alt="winnwell-52in-heavy-duty-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winnwell-52in-heavy-duty-shooting-target-1/public"/></a></div>

Additionally, the weighted bottom ensures the target keeps its shape during practice sessions.

One feature that really stood out was the 5 hole design, which allows me to practice a variety of shots.
