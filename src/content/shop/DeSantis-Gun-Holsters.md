As a gun owner, I've tried several holsters for my concealed carry needs. The Desantis Mini Scabbard Holster RH OWB Leather Kimber Micro BL has been an excellent choice, combining high-quality materials with practical features.

The adjustable tension screw is a standout feature that allows me to customize the retention level, ensuring my firearm stays securely in place while still offering a smooth draw. The slim design is perfect for concealing under light clothing or jackets and doesn't cause any irritation or chafing when worn all day.

The leather construction of this holster holds up well over time and maintains its shape even after extended use. It also minimizes printing, making it an ideal choice for everyday carry. Additionally, the close fit helps to keep the holster in place during physical activity without causing discomfort or fatigue.

In terms of performance and value for money, the Desantis Mini Scabbard Holster RH OWB Leather Kimber Micro BL exceeds expectations by providing a comfortable fit against my body and being compatible with different firearms or accessories.

### [Desantis Mini Scabbard Leather Gun Holster for Belt, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-mini-scab-kmbr-9-rh-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-mini-scab-kmbr-9-rh-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the DeSantis Leather Holster for a couple of months now with my Glock 19, and it has met my expectations. The holster is made from high-quality leather that provides a snug fit for secure carry. One highlight is its simple yet effective design, featuring an adjustable tension device that allows customization to prevent accidental drops or slips.

The belt slots accommodate up to a 1 3/4" belt width, ensuring stability when worn on the hip. It also offers good concealability as it rides close to the body without printing through lighter clothing like t-shirts. However, installing and removing from the belt can be challenging due to its immovable position once threaded into place.

So far, I have found this DeSantis Leather Holster to be an essential addition to my daily carry setup. Its combination of simplicity and functionality makes it a top choice among other holsters in the market right now. \xa0

Overall, I would recommend this holster for individuals seeking a reliable and secure carry option for their handgun, although I might compare it with other holsters in terms of comfort and draw speed before making a final decision.

### [Secure Leather Mini Scabbard Holster for Handguns by Desantis](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desantis-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-mini-scab-kmbr-9-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-mini-scab-kmbr-9-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Desantis Gun Holsters Mini Scabbard for my daily carry and have found it to be a secure and practical option for my handgun. The precise molding of the holster is spot-on, allowing me to keep a firm grip on my weapon. What really sets this holster apart is its excellent adjustable tension device which ensures easy access whenever I need it, while also providing ample retention control.

This simple leather design accommodates belts up to 1 3/4" wide and features belt slots that make it easy to position according to your comfort level. The tension screw gives you complete control over the snugness of the fit and really makes a difference in how securely your firearm stays in place.

One issue some users have reported is difficulty with installation or removal due to its tight fit on their belt loops – although I personally see this as an advantage since it prevents any unwanted movement during use. Another thing worth noting is that not all models feature an adjustable tension device, so be sure to double check before purchasing if this feature is important to you!

Overall, I highly recommend the Desantis Gun Holsters Mini Scabbard for anyone looking for reliable OWB leather rig at a reasonable price point; especially those seeking something practical yet affordable for everyday carry use!

The finish is smooth and well-crafted with an added touch of style to complement its functionality.

Initially concerned about the lack of a retention strap, I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustable friction retention feature that worked exceptionally well at keeping my gun in place even when shaking it vigorously upside down over my bed with an unloaded gun.

Overall, this DeSantis Mini Scabbard holster offers optimal concealability while providing quick accessibility of your weapon when needed - all at an affordable price point compared to similar options available on the market today!

The durable leather construction ensures a comfortable fit, and the tight grip on the handgun provides added security.

Many other holsters lack this level of customization, making it difficult to find that perfect balance between security and ease of draw. Additionally, its compatibility with belts up to 1 3/4" wide allows seamless integration with almost any belt in your wardrobe.

The compact nature of this holster makes it perfect for summer carry, even when wearing light layers like a t-shirt or vest - as long as your shirt isn't tucked in, printing won't be an issue. Though installation may require some effort due to its solid positioning, once secured in place it stays put without needing constant readjustment or worry about shifting throughout the day.

I've been using the DeSantis Apache ankle holster for my small-frame revolver for a few weeks now, and I have to say that it offers a comfortable and secure way to carry my gun. The elastic holster housing hugs the gun nicely, and the lambskin padding on the ankle band provides excellent comfort. While the velcro security strap ensures peace of mind in terms of keeping your revolver secure, it does hinder any form of efficient draw. However, with some practice, you can get used to the slower draw from this position.

One standout feature of this holster is its ability to keep your gun close to your leg, making it easy to conceal under clothing. The combination of elastic material and sheepskin lining makes for a comfortable fit while also preventing any unwanted rocking motion commonly associated with ankle holsters. Although there might be better ankle holsters on the market at a similar price point, this one is definitely a good performer worth considering if you're looking for something that doesn't print under your clothes while still providing reliable retention for your firearm.

Overall, I'm pleased with my experience using the DeSantis Apache ankle holster as it offers both comfort and security in carrying my small-frame revolver concealed at an affordable price point. Give it some thought if you're in need of such a product!

One standout feature is how well it conforms to my leg's contour and minimizes any unwanted rocking motion. This not only keeps my firearm securely in place but also helps reduce printing, making it an excellent choice for concealed carry situations.

However, I did find that adjusting the holster can be a bit tricky at times and may take some practice before finding the perfect fit. Additionally, although the Velcro closure on the thumb break strap is effective, it can sometimes be noisy when undoing it quickly.

Overall, I would still recommend this product to anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable ankle holster option. Its advantages in terms of comfort and concealment outweigh its minor drawbacks, making it a solid choice for those looking for an effective carry solution.

The sheepskin padding provides comfort and adds extra protection for my gun. The elastic band holds the holster securely on your leg and doesn't slide down even when you're walking or running. One thing I didn't like was that the thumb strap can sometimes dig into your leg if you don't adjust it properly. Despite this minor issue, this high-quality ankle holster gets the job done while remaining discreet - perfect for conceal carry!

Some unique features that make this standout from other holsters are its durable synthetic material, adjustable hook 'n' loop thumb break or thumb strap with hook 'n' loop closure (depending on model), and its comfortable sheepskin lining.
