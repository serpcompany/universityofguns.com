### [8-Inch Survival/Hunting Knife with Compass and Survival Kit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/utility-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=utility-knives&utm_term=8-inch-survivalhunting-knife-with-compass-and-survival-kit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/utility-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=utility-knives&utm_term=gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1"><img alt="gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used this survival knife for my outdoor adventures, I can confidently say that it's a versatile tool that won't let you down. The 8-inch stainless steel blade is built for cutting, chopping, and sawing, making it a dependable option for campers and hikers alike. A noteworthy feature is the included compass and survival kit tucked inside the handle, which transforms this product into an all-inclusive survival package.

I was impressed by the hollow handle design, as it not only reduces weight but also allows room to store additional items such as fishing gear or fire starters. The knife comes with a sharp edge right out of the box and maintains its sharpness well even after heavy usage. The serrated area on top of the blade provides extra functionality when sawing through tough materials like wood or bone.

Some users have reported issues with the screw that connects the handle to the blade becoming loose; however, using epoxy glue appears to be an effective solution for this issue as suggested by other reviewers. Despite these concerns, many users have expressed satisfaction with their overall experience with this high-quality survival knife at an affordable price point. In conclusion, I highly recommend this knife to anyone in search of a reliable tool for their outdoor adventures!

### [5" Utility Knife for Everyday Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/utility-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=utility-knives&utm_term=5-utility-knife-for-everyday-use)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/utility-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=utility-knives&utm_term=pampered-chef-5-utility-knife-1"><img alt="pampered-chef-5-utility-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pampered-chef-5-utility-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the 5" Utility Knife for my daily kitchen tasks, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance. The knife boasts an incredibly sharp blade that glides through fruits, vegetables, and meats with remarkable ease. Its well-balanced handle provides a comfortable grip that makes slicing and dicing an enjoyable experience.

One of the most appealing aspects of this knife is its versatility; it easily handles everything from trimming meat to slicing tomatoes. Cleanup is also a breeze as the knife is dishwasher safe.

However, there are some areas where improvements could be made. For instance, the blade width isn't as wide as other utility knives on the market (1 1/4" vs 1 1/2"), which can lead to your fingers getting pinched when gripping it for certain cuts. Additionally, the weight of the handle might not suit everyone's preferences - while some may find it perfect, others might find it too light or heavy depending on their individual needs.

Overall though? This 5" Utility Knife does an excellent job at what it was designed for - everyday kitchen tasks! If you're looking for something reliable that will make quick work out of food prep then look no further; this product won’t disappoint in terms of performance!

It locks into place securely when open, giving me confidence in its ability to handle tasks without any issues. Additionally, its TSA-safe status without the blade attached is a real game-changer for frequent travelers like myself who want to keep their EDC essentials with them at all times.

While there are many positive aspects about "The Palmer, " I did find that the grip can feel a bit slippery at times due to its smooth aluminum body - something that could be improved upon in future iterations. Nevertheless, overall, "The Palmer" from The James Brand is an excellent utility knife that perfectly combines form and function for my daily needs.

A standout feature is the safety guard covering the blade during top cutting, protecting fingers from potential harm. Another plus is the accessible blade storage compartment holding up to 5 safety point blades, making replacing dull blades a quick process.
