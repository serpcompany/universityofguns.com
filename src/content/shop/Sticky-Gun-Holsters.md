As an avid shooter, I've always been on the lookout for a holster that offers comfort and convenience. That's why I was excited to try out the Sticky Holsters Optics Ready 5 Modified (OR-5 MOD). It's designed for easy deployment and adjustment, meaning I can keep my focus on the target rather than fumbling with my gear.

One thing that really stood out to me about this holster is its ambidextrous design. As a lefty, I often find myself having to adapt to right-handed gear. But the OR-5 MOD is truly a one-size-fits-all solution. Plus, it adheres to my waistband, skin, and undergarments without any loops or clips getting in the way.

Another feature I appreciated was how well it accommodates most optic setups. It's made in the USA and fits various firearms like the CZ Rami, Glock 42, Ruger Max 9, S&W Shield, and SCCY CPX-RD. This versatility means I don't have to worry about buying different holsters for different guns.

The only downside I experienced was the difficulty of reholstering. However, considering its lightweight design and ability to keep my gun secure, I can overlook this small inconvenience. Overall, the Sticky Holsters OR-5 MOD has been a game-changer for me in terms of comfort and convenience while carrying my firearm.

I recently tried out the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65", and I must say it's a game-changer for those looking for comfortable and secure concealed carry options. The elastic construction of this belly band provides both strength and comfort, ensuring you won't feel restricted while wearing it.

One of the standout features for me was the "Sticky" material, which kept the band firmly in place without any movement or adjustments needed throughout the day. The built-in accessory pockets are also incredibly useful - they easily fit my spare magazine and folding knife, while the larger pocket accommodates my wallet, phone, and more.

Using this belly band as a travel band to discreetly store important documents has also been a lifesaver, especially when working out or going through crowded areas. The only downside I experienced was the lack of a built-in holster, but that is easily remedied by using a Sticky Holster in conjunction with the band.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65" for anyone in need of a versatile and comfortable concealed carry option that truly stands out from the competition.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sticky-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sticky-gun-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holsters-belly-band-small-1"><img alt="sticky-holsters-belly-band-small-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sticky-holsters-belly-band-small-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Sticky Holsters Belly Band Small for several weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer when it comes to concealed carry. The main feature that stands out for me is its versatility. Our patented belly band design works in conjunction with a Sticky Holster, allowing me to place my holster and gun in any position I feel comfortable with.

Another highlight is the quality of the material used in the belly band. Made with industrial strength plush elastic, it not only feels comfortable against my skin but also provides the strength needed to secure my firearm firmly. Plus, the three patches of sticky material ensure that the band stays in place throughout the day without any constant adjustments.

One area where I wish there was some improvement is the sizing. The band is designed to fit waist sizes between 24"-34", but I found it to be a bit too tight even for my 34" waist. More material would have been appreciated for a more secure fit.

In conclusion, the Sticky Holsters Belly Band Small offers unparalleled comfort, versatility, and concealment while being easy to use. Despite the sizing issues, I believe this product is worth considering if you're in the market for a reliable concealed carry solution.
