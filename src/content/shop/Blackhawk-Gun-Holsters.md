### [T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop for Duty Injection Molded Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-t-series-black-jacket-slot-belt-loop-clam-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-t-series-black-jacket-slot-belt-loop-clam-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid user of this product, I can tell you that the Blackhawk T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop has added significant comfort and ease to my daily carry routine. It's designed to fit any Blackhawk injection molded holster, making it the perfect companion for my duty gear. I particularly appreciate its thumb channel, which allows for improved clearance and use with gloved hands, a key feature when I'm on duty.

The belt loop provides a low-ride height that's quite ergonomic, making my draw much smoother. It's also compatible with single-leg strap attachments, fitting up to 2.25" duty belts. Plus, it's made in the USA, which is a testament to its quality.

However, one issue I've encountered is the lack of proper screws. To use this with my SERPA holster, I had to visit a hardware store to find the right-sized screws and washers. This could serve as a significant inconvenience for others who may not have access to such stores.

Despite this, I absolutely love the low-drop ride height this belt loop provides. It's perfect for my everyday work-carry setup and has made a significant difference in the comfort and accessibility of my sidearm. If you're in the market for a reliable, durable, and comfortable belt loop attachment, the Blackhawk T-Series Jacket Slot Belt Loop is worth considering.

### [Stache IWB Holster Kit for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-iwb-premium-holster-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-iwb-premium-holster-kit-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blackhawk Stache IWB is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and discreet holster. I've been using it with my Glock 43X, and it's been a game-changer. The injection-molded polymer provides enough rigidity to keep your gun secure, while also having enough flexibility to be comfortable during extended periods of wear. Plus, it's easily adjustable for both height and cant, making it a versatile option for any carry style.

One of the real standouts of this holster is the modularity. The ability to add accessories like the concealment claw, magazine carrier, and accessory attachment wing makes it a customizable platform that can adapt to your specific needs. And while it may not be as custom as a one-off holster from a leatherworker, the Blackhawk Stache IWB more than holds its own in terms of quality and functionality.

However, the main limitation I've experienced is the need to balance comfort and retention. While the adjustable retention screws help to keep your firearm secure, they can also create a slightly stiffer draw that may take some time to get used to. Overall, though, the Blackhawk Stache IWB is a solid choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality, comfortable, and adaptable holster system.

### [Blackhawk Serpa CQC Hellcat RH Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-hellcat-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-holster-hellcat-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

In my personal experience with the "Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster Hellcat RH" I must say that it has been a game-changer. Its unique speed-cut design ensures a swift draw and easy re-holstering without any hindrance, which is absolutely crucial in critical situations. The CQC (Close Quarters Concealment) holsters and accessories feature SERPA Technology, a user-friendly active retention system that automatically locks the weapon in place as you insert it into the holster. To release, you simply need to press the locking device outside the holster with your trigger finger - a feature that significantly speeds up the process.

The adjustable fit belt loop provided with the holster allows for customized fitting, making it suitable for all belts up to 1.75 inches wide. Besides, its unique carbon fiber and nylon construction offers excellent durability and retention, even during intense struggles.

However, the holster's hard material against the gun's surface could potentially remove the bluing on the face of the weapon, as highlighted by one users. I would also suggest that beginners take time to practice drawing and releasing their weapon from the holster to ensure safety and efficiency.

Overall, the "Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster Hellcat RH" has given me peace of mind knowing that my weapon is secure and yet accessible when needed. Its user-friendly design and robust construction have made it a reliable companion during my daily activities.

### [Blackhawk Stache IWB Base Holster Kit for Glock 48](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-iwb-base-holster-kit-glock-49" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-iwb-base-holster-kit-glock-49/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Blackhawk Stache IWB Base Holster Kit and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who carries a Glock 48, this holster has been the perfect fit - no pun intended! One of the things that I love about it is how comfortable it is to wear. The low profile shirt guard really adds to the overall comfort without inhibiting my draw stroke.

Another highlight for me is the adjustable belt clip. It's a 1.5-inch J-style clip that can be adjusted for height and cant, making it customizable to my liking. I also appreciate the fact that it's designed to accept popular Discreet Carry Concepts Gear Clips Mod-27.

While I've had a great experience with this holster, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the plastic material doesn't seem as sturdy as some other holsters I've used in the past. Secondly, the holster tends to wear on my clothing over time, which can be a bit of a hassle.

Despite these minor issues, I would definitely recommend the Blackhawk Stache IWB Base Holster Kit to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and adjustable holster for their Glock 48 or M&P Shield EZ 9mm gun.

### [Blackhawk L2C Colt 1911 OWB Holster, Right-Handed, Streamlined Thumb-Activated Retention](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-410703bkr-t-series-holster-l2c-colt-1912" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-410703bkr-t-series-holster-l2c-colt-1912/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Blackhawk 410703BKR T-Series Holster L2C Colt 1911 for a few months now, and it has truly become a game-changer for me. Its unique thumb-activated retention mechanism ensures that my firearm stays secure at all times while still being easily accessible when needed.

One of the standout features of this holster is its soundproof lining, which makes for a stealthy draw and holster, perfect for those situations where silence is crucial. The holster also boasts a minimalistic design with durable material, making it incredibly comfortable to wear throughout the day.

However, there are a couple of issues I've encountered. The plastic on some parts of the holster can be quite sharp, causing discomfort or even damage to clothing. Additionally, despite using a good quality belt, it still tends to have too much floppiness for my liking.

Despite these minor flaws, the Blackhawk T-Series Holster remains a reliable and innovative option for concealed carry. Its quick dual release belt loop and 2-slot belt loop add to its convenience, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking for an efficient and secure way to carry their handgun.

### [TecGrip IWB Holster: No Clip Needed, Secure Fit, Comfortable Wear](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-tecgrip-iwb-holster-04-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-tecgrip-iwb-holster-04-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Blackhawk TecGrip IWB Holster for my everyday carry firearms, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer. This holster doesn't require a clip, which has made it incredibly convenient for both concealed carry and comfortable wear. The TecGrip outer shell is specifically designed to stick to most materials, allowing it to hold fast without any assistance.

What's unique about this holster is its high-density closed-cell foam design. This not only offers a snug fit for your weapon, but it also ensures maximum comfort when you're wearing it. I've been using this holster with both my civilian and law enforcement firearms and it's performed exceptionally well in both situations.

One standout feature of the TecGrip Holster is its complete ambidextrous capability. This means it's suitable for right- and left-handed users, making it a versatile choice for anyone seeking an inside-the-waistband holster. The multiple sizes and various models available allow you to find the perfect fit for your specific firearm.

However, one minor drawback that some users may experience is the need to make adjustments to the holster's size. This was the case with one reviewer who needed to cut back part of the holster to accommodate their Kimber concealed carry 9mm. Nevertheless, this issue is relatively minor and can easily be resolved with a pair of scissors.

Another positive aspect I've noticed is the holster's durability. It's been over three years since I purchased mine, and it's still in perfect condition. With regular use for both EDC and hiking, I can attest to its longevity and reliability.

In conclusion, the Blackhawk TecGrip IWB Holster is a fantastic choice for anyone in need of a comfortable, reliable, and versatile holster. Its ability to stick securely without a clip, combined with its ambidextrous capabilities and multiple size options, make it a top contender in the world of inside-the-waistband holsters.

### [Blackhawk A.R.C. IWB Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-a-r-c-iwb-holster-sig-p365-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blackhawk - A. R. C. IWB Holster for Sig P365 has been my loyal companion for concealed carry. Its fully ambidextrous design and adjustable cant and ride height make it a versatile choice for both civilian and law enforcement use. The soft yet durable injection molded polymer material provides comfort while maintaining its robustness. The passive retention detent with adjustment screw ensures a secure fit for my Sig P365, while the inclusion of two belt clips accommodates belts ranging from 1.5" to 1.75".

I must admit that at times, it can be a bit challenging to adjust as per my preference, but with a little patience and understanding, I was able to utilize it effectively. One of the features that stood out for me was the capacity to use rear-mounted red dots, making it a perfect fit for modern concealed carry setups.

However, I found that the belt clips lacked proper indexing notches for maintaining a consistent cant angle. This issue led me to return the holster and look for alternatives that provide better stability and precision during draws.

Overall, the Blackhawk - A. R. C. IWB Holster for Sig P365 offers an affordable and functional option for concealed carry, but it may not be perfect for everyone. It's worth trying out if you value versatility and adjustable features, but keep in mind that there might be some room for improvement in terms of belt clip stability.

I've been using the Blackhawk T-ser L3D Sig BK holster for a while now, and I can't begin to tell you how much I love it. It's incredibly reliable and extremely secure, making it an absolute must-have for anyone who is serious about their safety. The streamlined, thumb-activated Level 3 retention feature allows for quick and efficient drawing even under the most stressful circumstances.

One of the standout features of this holster is the strap that goes over the back of the slide, providing enhanced security for your firearm. Plus, the sleek design reduces bulk without sacrificing any of the durability you'd expect from a top-notch product like this one.

However, I must admit that there's one minor issue with the holster â€“ the fit can be a little finicky from time to time. But honestly, it's such a minor inconvenience when you consider all the fantastic features this holster has to offer.

### [Blackhawk Serpa CQC Concealment Handgun Holster for Colt 1911 - Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-cqc-concealment-handgun-holster-colt-1911-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-cqc-concealment-handgun-holster-colt-1911-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I must say, I've been thoroughly impressed with the Blackhawk Serpa CQC Concealment Handgun Holster. As someone who's been using it to carry my Colt 1911, I can attest to its reliability and ease of use. The SERPA Auto Lock provides optimal security for my weapon, and the index finger release ensures a swift draw when I need it.

One thing that really stands out about this holster is the adjustable retention detent screw. It's allowed me to customize the fit of the holster according to my preference for deep concealment and comfort. Plus, the fact that it's compatible with various belt loop platforms, paddle platforms, and other tactical accessories is a major plus.

Now, there are a few minor cons worth mentioning. First off, the packaging could use some improvement. My holster arrived with a few minor scuffs, which isn't a huge deal, but it would be nice to see better protection during shipping. Additionally, although the auto lock feature is excellent in terms of security, it does take a little getting used to when it comes to drawing and reholstering the weapon.

All in all, I'm extremely happy with my Blackhawk SERPA CQC Concealment Handgun Holster. Its impressive features and adjustability options make it a top choice for anyone in need of a reliable, adjustable, and compatible handgun holster.

### [Blackhawk Stache IWB Holster for S&W Shield 9/40](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-stache-holster-iwb-sw-shield-9-40-prem-kit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-stache-holster-iwb-sw-shield-9-40-prem-kit-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Blackhawk Stache IWB Holster and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This holster is made from heavy-duty, injection molded polymer which provides both rigidity and comfort while wearing it inside-the-waistband. What really stood out to me was how adjustable it is, making it suitable for both left and right-handed carries, as well as various modular configurations or carry positions. The friction adjustable passive retention ensures that your weapon stays securely in place, but it's also incredibly easy to draw when needed.

The Blackhawk Stache IWB Holster comes with a premium configuration that includes an adjustable concealment claw to reduce printing, an adjustable inside-the-waistband magazine carrier with a belt clip, and an accessory attachment wing for joining the holster and mag carrier into one platform. This makes it incredibly versatile and adaptable to different carry styles and preferences.

One feature that really took me by surprise was how compatible this holster is with most popular handgun mounted RDS optics, as well as Blackhawk's own Stache IWB carry accessories and popular Discreet Carry Concepts Gear Clips Mod-4. This allows you to further customize your carry setup according to your needs and preferences.

Despite some minor drawbacks, such as needing assembly upon arrival, I believe that the Blackhawk Stache IWB Holster outshines many of its competitors in terms of comfort, modularity, and build quality. Its compatibility with various handgun models and accessories makes it an excellent choice for everyday carry.

### [Blackhawk T-Series L2C Overt Gun Belt Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/blackhawk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-t-series-l2c-overt-gun-belt-holster-kit-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-t-series-l2c-overt-gun-belt-holster-kit-black-1/public"/></a></div>

As someone who had spent countless hours at the range, I knew the importance of a reliable, comfortable, and efficient holster. When I first came across the Blackhawk T-Series L2C Overt Gun Belt Holster Kit, I was intrigued by its unique design and the promise of easy access to my firearm.

The L2C doesn't disappoint. Its low profile and light weight make it a comfortable choice for extended periods of use, whether you're on duty or out in the field. The Speed Cut geometry, which is absent in its taller counterpart, the L2D, not only allows for quick drawing and re-holstering but also makes the holster inherently optic compatible.

One of my favorite things about the L2C is its versatility. With the ability to accommodate leg straps or belt loops, it's easy to find a setup that works for you. Plus, its compatibility with dedicated gun belts means that you can carry all of your essential gear in one convenient place.

However, the L2C does have a few downsides. Its sleek design can make it slightly difficult to adjust or remove, especially when wearing gloves. Additionally, the lack of a taller sight track shroud can lead to occasional snagging on clothing or gear.

Overall, the Blackhawk T-Series L2C Overt Gun Belt Holster Kit has been a solid addition to my range and self-defense gear. Its versatile design, quick draw functionality, and compatibility with dedicated gun belts make it a top choice among serious shooters. While there are some minor drawbacks to consider, the L2C offers an exceptional balance of comfort, convenience, and efficiency that's hard to beat.

As a daily concealed carry user, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years. The Blackhawk A. R. C. IWB Holster for the Sig P365XL is one that's stood out positively for its level of comfort and ease of use.

Designed to accommodate both civilian and law enforcement carry, this fully ambidextrous holster provides full flexibility in terms of cant and ride height adjustment. The inclusion of two belt clips caters to different belt widths, from 1.5-inch to 1.75-inch, making it a highly adaptable option.

The holster itself is made from a soft yet durable injection-molded polymer material. This provides both comfort and retention, with an adjustment screw allowing you to set the right tension for your weapon. An interesting feature is the ability to accommodate rear-mounted red dots, adding extra functionality to this holster.

However, not everything is perfect. Some users have reported issues with the fit, especially for non-Sig firearms. The belt clips, while functional, could be made more robust to provide a better overall experience.

In conclusion, the Blackhawk A. R. C. IWB Holster for the Sig P365XL is a comfortable, adaptable, and functional choice for concealed carry. While there are some minor niggles, the overall quality and value for money make it a worthwhile considerable option.
