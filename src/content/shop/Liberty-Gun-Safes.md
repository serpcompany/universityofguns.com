### [Centurion 24-Gun Steel Fire-Rated Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="centurion-24-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/centurion-24-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Liberty Centurion 24 Gun Safe for a few months, and it definitely stands out among other gun safes in the market. Firstly, the digital keypad locking system is a breeze to set up and use. It provides quick and easy access to my valuables, while still ensuring optimal security. Plus, the hard plate lock protection gives me the peace of mind knowing that my belongings are safe from potential break-ins.

One of the highlights of this safe is its spaciousness. I've been able to fit all of my long guns in it, along with some important documents and other valuables. Its ample storage makes it perfect for those who want a one-stop solution for securing their belongings. The Centurion not only looks good but also provides good protection due to its sturdy steel construction.

However, it's worth mentioning that setting up the interior padding could be slightly improved. I encountered some minor issues with it, but it wasn't enough to detract from the overall performance of the safe. Additionally, the absence of lights inside the safe might be a downside for some users, but I managed to work around this by adding a motion-activated LED light strip, which has worked well for me.

In conclusion, the Liberty Centurion 24 Gun Safe has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and protection. Its spacious interior and user-friendly locking system make it a reliable choice for those looking to secure their valuables. While there are some minor flaws, they are easily outweighed by its benefits. I would highly recommend this safe to anyone in need of a secure storage solution.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="liberty-safe-freedom-48-gun-safe-electronic-lock-black-fdm48-bkt-40e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-freedom-48-gun-safe-electronic-lock-black-fdm48-bkt-40e-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe to improve the security of my collection at an affordable price. As a serious collector who needed extra protection for my investments, this safe's solid security features won me over. The USA 48 offers a full 60 minutes of certified fire resistance at 1200°F and a level 2 security rating, protecting my valuable possessions.

One highlight that stood out for me was its ample storage capacity, which can hold up to 48 guns at once. This is perfect for someone like me who likes to keep a variety of weapons without worrying about space constraints. Additionally, the electronic lock provides quick and easy access to my collection while ensuring top-notch security.

However, I did encounter some challenges during setup. Although the digital lock is of good quality compared to cheaper alternatives, programming it can be a bit cumbersome if you're not tech-savvy. Another downside is the sheer weight of the safe – it requires at least two people to move around, which could be problematic in tight spaces.

Overall, the Liberty Safe Freedom 48 Gun Safe has been a reliable addition to my collection, offering excellent protection and ample storage capacity. While there were a few hiccups during setup, its high-quality craftsmanship and ease of use make it an attractive option for gun owners looking for an affordable yet effective solution.

### [Liberty Gun Safe - 64 Long Guns, Colonial 50, 1 Hour Fire Protection, 11 Gauge Steel](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="liberty-gun-safe-colonial-50-co50-1-hour-fire-64-long-guns-11-gauge-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-gun-safe-colonial-50-co50-1-hour-fire-64-long-guns-11-gauge-1/public"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I inherited a collection of old firearms from my late uncle. They were beautiful, historically significant, and also quite valuable. But, they needed a safe place to call home. That's when my husband surprised me with the Liberty Gun Safe Colonial 50 CO50. Boy, was I blown away!

First and foremost, the fire protection this safe provides is astounding. With its 1-hour, 1200°F fire rating, I know my precious guns are protected against any unforeseen fires. The 11-gauge steel door provides extra security, and the 64 long gun capacity is more than enough for my collection. Plus, the safe is spacious enough to accommodate other valuables.

Now, for the cons, it's a bit heavy. The safe weighs nearly 1000 pounds, so moving it can be quite the challenge. Additionally, while the lock is secure, it can be a bit fiddly to operate. However, these minor inconveniences are overshadowed by the impeccable fire protection and security it provides.

In conclusion, the Liberty Gun Safe Colonial 50 CO50 is a reliable, high-quality treasure chest for my firearms. Its superior fire protection and ample capacity make it a worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to safeguard their valuables. Despite its weight and finicky lock, its advantages outweigh the drawbacks, transforming it into a reliable home for my treasured heirlooms.

Its high security doesn't compromise on easy accessibility. It allows you to securely store your handgun and other valuables, making it an excellent choice for anyone concerned about safety. Plus, it's a quality product made right here in the USA.

There are a few cons to consider, though. The vault is a bit on the larger side, which could be a turnoff for some. Additionally, while the biometric system is generally reliable, it might be a bit finicky at times, especially during the initial setup phase.

Overall, with its exceptional security features and ease of access, Liberty's HDV-150X vault is a solid choice for those looking to store their handgun and valuables securely. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, its performance and quality more than make up for it.

One feature that truly stands out for me is the 3-in-1 flex interior. It provides incredible flexibility, allowing me to customize the layout to suit my unique collection. However, there is one drawback - the door. Due to its size, it consumes some of the outer layer racks, which can be a bit inconvenient for certain items. A minor inconvenience, but something worth considering for potential buyers.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my Liberty USA 36 Gun Safe. It offers incredible security, a generous amount of storage, and a design that seamlessly blends into my home. If you're in the market for a reliable gun safe that won't break the bank, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

### [Liberty Franklin Series 23 Gun Safe, Spacious 25.7 Cu Ft Storage, 110 Minutes Fire Protection, Made in USA](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/liberty-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="liberty-gun-safe-franklin-series-23-110-minutes-at-1200o-f-made-in-usa-fr23-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-gun-safe-franklin-series-23-110-minutes-at-1200o-f-made-in-usa-fr23-1/public"/></a></div>

In my personal experience, I've found that the Liberty Gun Safe Franklin Series 23 offers unmatched protection for all my prized possessions. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, polished appearance, which easily complements the style of my home. The two available lock types, a variety of colors, and three hardware styles allow me to personalize the safe to fit seamlessly into any room.

The standout feature for me was its 4-in-1 Flex interior, which provides multiple configurations tailored to my specific needs. Whether I'm storing long guns in the Sportsman configuration, or frequently accessing them with the EZ-Access layout, I'm always satisfied with the safe's flexibility and functionality.

In addition to its appearance, the Liberty Gun Safe excels in fire protection. It boasts 110 minutes of certified fire protection at 1200 °F, ensuring my valuable documents and firearms remain well-protected during any unexpected emergencies.

The safe's security features are also top-notch, with a UL-listed safe body and 12-gauge steel door, making it incredibly difficult to break into. Plus, the Liberty Gun Safe comes equipped with an upgraded DX-90 Monster Mech locking mechanism and dual relocker locks, providing further protection against forced entry attempts.

While the Franklin Series 23 exceeded my expectations, I do have some minor complaints. The delivery service provided by Lowes was lacking in proper equipment and manpower to move the safe safely. Additionally, the granite textured finish was more affordable but not as visually appealing as the burgundy marble gloss option I ultimately chose.

In conclusion, the Liberty Gun Safe Franklin Series 23 is a remarkable product that provides exceptional protection, flexibility, and style for all my valuable belongings.
