It gives me added peace of mind knowing that my belongings are not only secure within the safe but also protected from being stolen.

However, one area where the safe could have been improved is the digital lock. While it works perfectly well, its quality doesn't quite match up with the rest of the safe.

In conclusion, the Fortress large personal fire and waterproof safe is a trustworthy companion for safeguarding my valuable items.
