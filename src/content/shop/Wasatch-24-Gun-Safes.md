I've been using the Liberty Centurion 24 Gun Safe for a few months, and it definitely stands out among other gun safes in the market. Firstly, the digital keypad locking system is a breeze to set up and use. It provides quick and easy access to my valuables, while still ensuring optimal security. Plus, the hard plate lock protection gives me the peace of mind knowing that my belongings are safe from potential break-ins.

One of the highlights of this safe is its spaciousness. I've been able to fit all of my long guns in it, along with some important documents and other valuables. Its ample storage makes it perfect for those who want a one-stop solution for securing their belongings. The Centurion not only looks good but also provides good protection due to its sturdy steel construction.

However, it's worth mentioning that setting up the interior padding could be slightly improved. I encountered some minor issues with it, but it wasn't enough to detract from the overall performance of the safe. Additionally, the absence of lights inside the safe might be a downside for some users, but I managed to work around this by adding a motion-activated LED light strip, which has worked well for me.

In conclusion, the Liberty Centurion 24 Gun Safe has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and protection. Its spacious interior and user-friendly locking system make it a reliable choice for those looking to secure their valuables.

I recently got the Surelock Cadet 24 Gun & Home Safe to keep my valuable possessions safe and secure. This safe is a game changer! It's huge, with enough space to hold up to 24 guns, and the adjustable shelves make organizing a breeze. The color is really nice too, a deep mocha on the outside and a light tan interior.

The built-in LED light bar and USB ports are also great additions, making it easy and convenient to charge my phone or other electronic devices while they're stored safely inside.

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. The door storage is a little limited, and I wish there were more options for organizing my smaller items.
