<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker for my compact pistol and have been using it consistently. This holster is designed to be carried in the front pocket of your pants, providing an alternative for those who don't prefer carrying their firearm around their waistline.

One feature that stands out with this holster is the ability to draw your weapon in three different ways. When you grab your firearm from your pocket, a hook on the corner helps you quickly retrieve your gun. Additionally, you can use the eyelet hardware provided to attach paracord to securely hold it in a bag or purse. Lastly, there's an optional thumb tab that lets you unholster your gun with a simple thumb press.

The custom Kydex mold fit my Glock 43X perfectly, providing a secure and snug fit without any issues while sitting or bending over. Although I noticed some printing when wearing it, it wasn't easily distinguishable as a handgun by others. The optional curve and thumb tab made ejecting the weapon smooth and effortless while providing resistance needed for smoother drawing motions.

Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase of Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker as it offers great comfort and flexibility for concealed carry enthusiasts seeking alternatives to traditional methods like IWB or OWB carry options.

### [Crucial Concealment Covert Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=crucial-concealment-covert-sig-p365-x-macro-iwb-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently been using the "Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO" in my day-to-day routine and must say it's been quite an experience. The minimalistic design isn't just for show, it really does deliver on its promise of effective concealment without sacrificing comfort.

One of the standout features for me was the trigger bump. It added an extra layer of safety without being intrusive or uncomfortable, which is quite impressive. Plus, the fully adjustable cant and adjustable retention make it perfect for anyone, regardless of their preferences. Another thing that really caught my attention is how compatible it is with optics, making it a versatile choice for those looking to upgrade their gear.

However, there are some things that could be improved. While the holster material, kydex, is durable and reliable, it might not suit everyone's taste due to its hard and rigid nature. Additionally, some people might find the black color too plain and boring, but then again, that's mostly down to personal preferences.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient inside-the-waistband holster that offers solid concealment capabilities, the Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO would be a great choice.

### [Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes Handgun Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/public"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my handgun storage solution, and it's been a game-changer. Before, I had to stack my firearms on the shelves, which not only took up a lot of space but also sometimes scratched their finishes. Now, with these clever holsters, I can store all of my handguns securely and make the most of the space inside my gun safe.

One of the main highlights of these holsters is their ease of use. Simply attach the Velcro side to a carpeted wall, insert your handgun, and boom! You've got a secure and accessible storage solution. No more clutter or scratched finishes, and best of all, no more stacking.

However, I did experience a minor inconvenience while installing these holsters. The screws that came with them were too short for my metal-door safe, so I had to visit Home Depot to purchase longer ones. Additionally, I would have preferred if the Velcro on the back of the holsters came with a plus or "X" pattern to eliminate any wobbling. But overall, these holsters have been a fantastic addition to my gun safe.

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters provide a simple and effective solution for storing handguns in your gun safe. With their easy installation and accessibility, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them. So, if you're looking for a way to clear up some space and secure your handguns, I highly recommend giving these holsters a try.

### [Galco ambidextrous VHS 4.0 Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=galco-ambidextrous-vhs-40-shoulder-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/desk-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=desk-gun-holsters&utm_term=galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-tan-1"><img alt="galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-tan-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-tan-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had the pleasure of using several shoulder holsters. However, the Galco VHS 4.0 for my 1911 4-5" really takes the cake. This ambidextrous beauty is a game-changer, especially when I need quick access to my firearm. The vertical double magazine carrier with its secure flaps is just the icing on the cake.

One of the standout features of the Galco VHS 4.0 is its comfortable wide harness. It's designed with a swiveling Flexalon backplate, providing a level of comfort that lasts all day. Plus, it's incredibly versatile, offering compatibility with various firearm sizes and body types. The adjustable harness ensures a perfect fit for both left and right-handed users.

However, no product is perfect. One minor issue I experienced was the occasional need for adjustments to maintain a secure fit. Additionally, the magazine carrier could benefit from a tie-down feature for added stability.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galco VHS 4.0 is an exceptional shoulder holster. Its ergonomic design and versatility make it an ideal choice for shooters who prioritize comfort and convenience. Whether you're a lefty or a righty, this holster is sure to provide a secure and comfortable home for your 1911.

The fit is perfect, and the top pouch for an extra magazine is super convenient. Made from ballistic nylon with a molded polymer frame, this holster boasts a sleek design and adjustable web strap for a customizable fit.
