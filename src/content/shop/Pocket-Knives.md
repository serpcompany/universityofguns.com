### [8-Inch Survival/Hunting Knife with Compass and Survival Kit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pocket-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pocket-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used this survival knife for my outdoor adventures, I can confidently say that it's a versatile tool that won't let you down. The 8-inch stainless steel blade is built for cutting, chopping, and sawing, making it a dependable option for campers and hikers alike. A noteworthy feature is the included compass and survival kit tucked inside the handle, which transforms this product into an all-inclusive survival package.

I was impressed by the hollow handle design, as it not only reduces weight but also allows room to store additional items such as fishing gear or fire starters. The knife comes with a sharp edge right out of the box and maintains its sharpness well even after heavy usage. The serrated area on top of the blade provides extra functionality when sawing through tough materials like wood or bone.

Some users have reported issues with the screw that connects the handle to the blade becoming loose; however, using epoxy glue appears to be an effective solution for this issue as suggested by other reviewers. Despite these concerns, many users have expressed satisfaction with their overall experience with this high-quality survival knife at an affordable price point. In conclusion, I highly recommend this knife to anyone in search of a reliable tool for their outdoor adventures!

The blade itself is made from stainless steel that holds its edge extremely well and is incredibly sharp right out of the box. Its versatility truly shines through when put to the test in different scenarios; whether you're skinning game or cutting rope for your tent setup – this knife can handle it all. The handle design provides just enough friction without being too slippery or uncomfortable during extended use which was great for long days out in nature.

I also appreciate the oversized lanyard hole that lets me easily attach a cord or lanyard for added security during use or transportation. The drop point blade made from CPM-S35VN steel is sharp right out of the box and retains its edge well over time with minimal maintenance required. This makes it perfect for a variety of tasks like slicing through rope or cutting open packages with ease. The satin finish gives the blade an understated yet stylish look that adds to its appeal as an Everyday Carry (EDC) tool/knife; whether you're camping, hiking, fishing, hunting - you name it!

After using the redesigned Ellis for some time now, I have to say it has quickly become my go-to EDC item. The knife features a well-crafted partially serrated Swedish Sandvik 12C27 stainless steel blade that holds an edge remarkably well. Additionally, the scissors are sharp and efficient, making them great for everyday tasks like cutting threads or opening packages.

A standout feature is the deep-carry wire clip that secures the knife in place and allows for easy access when needed. This makes the Ellis highly versatile; it feels at home whether worn with jeans or a suit.

Getting used to the slip joint design was a slight hiccup as I had previously used locking blades. However, after some practice, I found it quite easy and comfortable to operate. And while there have been a few instances where paint has chipped off, it doesn't affect the functionality of the knife nor detract from its sleek, modern appearance in any significant way.

Overall, this is an excellent product that combines style with practicality seamlessly. It offers everything you need in an EDC without any unnecessary frills—a true workhorse that can handle various tasks with ease while still looking sharp (pun intended).

The construction quality is unmatched – made in Switzerland by Victorinox, a company renowned for their tough and long-lasting products.

While there are definitely more pros than cons, one slight downside is that the knife feels a bit cluttered with so many functions when trying to retrieve specific tools quickly. And although the personalization with engraving adds a nice touch, it may not be worth the extra cost for some people.
