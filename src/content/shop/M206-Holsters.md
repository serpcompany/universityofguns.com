### [Tactical OWB Holster for Sig P226 - Made in USA](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="classic-owb-holster-sig-p226-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/classic-owb-holster-sig-p226-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the Blade-Tech Classic OWB holster for a couple of weeks with my firearm, I can say that the adjustable retention feature is a game-changer. Being able to easily tighten or loosen the fit around my gun has been extremely convenient, and the fact that it's made in the USA from strong Boltaron adds to its durability. The positive locking trigger guard provides peace of mind by giving me tactile feedback when my firearm is securely in place.

However, some users have reported difficulty with adjusting the screws and fitting certain optics on their firearms. This may vary based on individual preferences and specific firearms models. Despite this, I believe that the IDPA & USPSA legal optic ready speed cut feature makes it ideal for both tactical and competition use. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase of the Blade-Tech Classic OWB holster for its adjustability, durability, and functionality.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sig-p365-p365x-no-light-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sig-p365-p365x-no-light-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster for my Sig P365 / P365X, I was thoroughly impressed with its versatility and design. The toolless design allows for quick transitions from inside to outside the waistband, and the modular adaptability ensures that you can customize it to your specific needs by simply swapping out the Mod-Lok system.

One of my favorite aspects is its ambidextrous design, perfect for both right and left-handed shooters. The holster boasts a superior fit and is made in the USA from high-strength, heat-resistant polymers that are built to last. Its slim profile sits closer to your body than ever before, allowing for seamless movement without printing – ideal for concealed carry.

The secure fit of this holster keeps your firearm in place while emitting a satisfying click when reholstering – an audible confirmation that your weapon is secure at all times. With its wide range of features and adjustability options, it's clear that Blade-Tech has gone above and beyond in providing responsible gun owners with a reliable product that excels in concealed carry scenarios.

### [IWB Kydex Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this Kydex holster for my concealed carry needs and have been using it daily. One of the standout features of this holster is its precise fit for my specific gun model, providing me with an audible click when I securely holster my gun, giving me peace of mind that it's held in place safely.

The quality of the Kydex material is impressive, as it is durable, waterproof, and lightweight. I also appreciate the adjustable retention feature which allows me to customize the holster according to my preferences. The fully adjustable design makes it easy to change the carry angle or position without having to purchase a new holster entirely.

However, there are a few areas where I believe this product could improve further. For example, when carrying appendix style with the optional claw attachment, printing can still be an issue even after adjusting various settings on the claw itself. Additionally, although most reviews report solid construction some customers have experienced minor issues such as screws loosening over time so it's worth noting these potential drawbacks before making your purchase decision!

Overall this Kydex Holster from Odin offers good value for money considering its lifetime guarantee against defects along with other great features like being waterproof and offering a precise fit for your specific gun model.

I recently tested the C&G Covert OWB kydex holster, and I must say, it's one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've tried. The adjustable retention screw lets you customize how tightly your gun fits, ensuring a smooth draw when needed while keeping your gun secure. The geometry of this holster works well to keep my firearm in place without causing discomfort or chafing during extended periods of wear.

In terms of design, the sleek appearance and durability provided by the kydex material make it an excellent choice for everyday use. The belt clip is also comfortable enough for all-day wear while keeping my gun close to my body. This holster can fit a wide variety of firearms and light combinations, making it an incredibly versatile option for concealed carry.

Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution that balances functionality with comfort.

The ability to accommodate a wide range of firearms makes it suitable for carrying regardless of the type of gun you own. The lightness ensures extended periods of wear without feeling weighed down by bulky equipment, even while wearing heavy clothing like jackets or vests.

### [Total Eclipse 2.0 Modular Holster for Sig Sauer P320C / M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sig-p320c-m18-no-light-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sig-p320c-m18-no-light-1/public"/></a></div>

As a firearms instructor, I recently had the opportunity to test the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster with my Sig P320C / M18. The holster's auto-locking, toolless design made it extremely easy to switch between OWB and IWB carry without any hassle. And the ambidextrous design ensured that both left and right-handed shooters could easily use it.

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its high-strength, heat-resistant polymer construction which allowed for a superior fit for my Sig P320C / M18. The slim design also helped to conceal what matters most by sitting closer to my body than ever before. This minimized printing and ensured that my firearm stayed in place as intended while naturally moving with my body.

The positive lock trigger guard was a great feature that provided me with tactile feedback indicating when my firearm was securely in place. And the audible click when reholstering gave me added confidence that my weapon was safely locked in place every time I reholstered it, allowing me peace of mind while carrying it daily or during training sessions. Overall, I'd highly recommend the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 Holster as an excellent choice for those looking for versatility, reliability, and comfort in their everyday carry or training holsters – especially for users of Sig P320C/M18 handguns!

### [Total Eclipse 2.0 Holster for S&W M&P Shield 9/40 with Mod-Lok System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sw-mp-shield-9-40-3-1-not-optics-compa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/total-eclipse-2-0-holster-with-appendix-iwb-mag-pouch-mod-kit-sw-mp-shield-9-40-3-1-not-optics-compa-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster for Smith & Wesson Shield 9/40/Plus is an innovative product that offers a versatile and reliable experience. The auto-locking, toolless design with Mod-Lok makes it easy to transition from OWB to IWB carry, and the modular adaptability allows you to choose quick-release Mods that fit your individual needs. It's also great to have the ambidextrous holster design as it accommodates both left and right-handed shooters.

One of the particularly impressive features is the positive lock trigger guard which provides tactile feedback, ensuring that the firearm remains secure at all times. However, there is one thing that I would like to see improved in future iterations - metal belt clips instead of plastic construction. While they are currently durable through various means, they may eventually fail or break over time.

Overall, this holster earns an A++ for its durability and versatility. Finding a holster that meets these criteria can be challenging, but Blade-Tech manages to deliver with their Total Eclipse 2. 0 Holster for S&W Shield 9/40/Plus.

### [Inside Waistband Holster for Ruger LCR](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="klipt-iwb-holster-for-ruger-lcr-from-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klipt-iwb-holster-for-ruger-lcr-from-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tested the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Ruger LCR and was impressed by its slim design and high sweat guard. The holster fit snugly onto my belt with the easy on/easy off belt clip, providing a secure and comfortable carry experience.

The high sweat guard stood out to me as it kept my firearm from getting uncomfortable from moisture or slide serrations. Additionally, the precision molding ensured a great fit for my Ruger LCR. The holster's high strength and heat resistant polymer construction made it feel durable and well-built.

Another feature that I appreciated was the built-in retention that provided both security and tactile feedback whenever needed. It gave me peace of mind knowing that my handgun was secure without any adjustments required.

One minor drawback of this product is that it may take a bit of time to get used to the single piece design, which lacks some customizability that other multi-piece holsters offer. However, once I got used to it, I found it simple to attach via the 1. 5" belt clip and enjoyed its smooth edges and full-length sweat guard during long hours of wear.

Despite being designed primarily for everyday carry, this no nonsense holster quickly became one of my favorites thanks to its balance of comfort and security features. Overall, if you're looking for a reliable concealed carry option without any bulkiness or fussy adjustments, then Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for the Ruger LCR could be an excellent choice!

### [Ambidextrous Total Eclipse Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I've been using the Total Eclipse holster for a while now and it has really exceeded my expectations. The best part about this holster is its ambidextrous design that allows me to switch between left or right-hand shooting with ease. I also appreciate the full-length sweat guard that not only prevents discomfort but also ensures there are no sharp edges against my skin.

One of the standout features for me is the positive lock trigger guard which provides a satisfying tactile feedback every time I secure my firearm in place. Made from high strength, heat-resistant polymer in the USA, this holster fits my gun perfectly thanks to its precise molding, which ensures optimal fit and performance.

However, there are some minor cons worth mentioning. The extra sweat guard on both sides can be an issue when reholstering since I had to adjust to its design feature by being more conscious during this process. Some users might find that while the Kydex construction is rigid and durable as per product description, it may be more flexible than they prefer in a holster setup.

Despite these minor cons, I’m overall pleased with what is undeniably a high-quality concealment holster with exceptional retention capabilities that makes me feel confident having it at my side whether on duty or off!

### [Adjustable IWB Kydex Holster for S&W M&P Shield 9mm/.40 TLR-6](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m206-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

After using the IWB Profile Series holster from Tulster for several months, I must say it's an exceptional minimalistic solution for everyday carry. Its sleek design and high-quality materials have made it a daily go-to. The matte edge finish is comfortable, and the low profile ensures that my firearm remains concealed while carrying.

The adjustable retention screw makes dialing in the perfect fit easy, keeping my gun secure when holstered. The undercut trigger guard promotes a higher grip on my handgun and allows me to release the magazine while it's still holstered - an especially convenient feature when quick access is needed. Being able to adjust cant settings from 0 to 30 degrees provides more flexibility in terms of finding a comfortable carry position – whether appendix carry, strong-side carry or kidney carry.

Overall, this product has proven itself as an excellent choice for concealed carrying solutions. Its attention to detail like comfort and ease of use make all the difference during long days while providing peace of mind knowing that my firearm is safely secured close at hand whenever needed, without drawing attention from others around me.
