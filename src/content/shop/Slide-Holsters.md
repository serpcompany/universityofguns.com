## Reviews

### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for Tanfoglio Stock II](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="tanfoglio-stock-ii-owb-holster-right-handed-tanfoglio-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tanfoglio-stock-ii-owb-holster-right-handed-tanfoglio-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

After testing the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for my Tanfoglio Stock II, I was impressed by its adjustable retention feature, which allowed me to fine-tune the fit around my gun for a secure and snug feel. The modular mounting holes also provided flexibility when customizing my draw and ride with compatible attachments.

The IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design proved excellent in competition, enabling a quick muzzle release from the holster without hassles. Additionally, the positive locking trigger guard provided reassurance that my firearm was securely stored at all times.

Although I faced difficulty tightening or loosening screws on one side while adjusting retention, Blade-Tech's customer support provided helpful tips that effectively resolved this issue. Overall, this holster checks all boxes regarding precision fitment and performance-driven features, making it an excellent choice for serious marksmen demanding top-notch equipment quality.

### [Adjustable Right Hand OWB Holster for Small Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="snapslide-owb-holster-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapslide-owb-holster-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

The SnapSlide and DropSlide holsters both offer a comfortable, secure fit for my firearms. I appreciate the adjustable retention on both, which allows me to customize the level of security and ease of access. The leather construction makes them comfortable against my skin and doesn't cause any irritation. The lower mounting position of the DropSlide makes it easier to draw from, but it can be more difficult to conceal the muzzle. On the other hand, the SnapSlide offers better concealment but requires a little more effort to draw from. Overall, both options are solid choices depending on your specific needs - whether it be ease of drawing or superior concealment.

### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for FN FNX-45 Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster has proven to be a reliable and durable option for my FN FNX-45 Tactical. Its high-quality construction, crafted from Boltaron in the USA, provides a precise and secure fit that I can trust on the range or in competition.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the adjustable retention screws. These allow me to customize the level of security between my firearm and the holster with ease. Additionally, the optic ready speed cut design provides me with an edge during competitions by enabling quick clearance of the muzzle out of the holster. It's no surprise that both IDPA and USPSA have legalized this product for use in their competitions, further showcasing its effectiveness.

Another great aspect of this holster is its modular mounting holes which provide versatility when tailoring it to my specific draw and ride preferences using Blade-Tech's compatible attachments. The positive locking trigger guard also offers tactile feedback while storing my firearm safely throughout the day without any concerns about accidental exposure or loss.

However, there were some minor issues when initially setting up this product as some adjustment screws spun freely instead of securing into place once set up according to desired positioning - something which was resolved through customer support assistance via email correspondences within a reasonable timeframe nevertheless. Despite these small hiccups, overall –this remains a solid choice worth considering for those looking for reliable carry options.

### [Slim and Discreet IWB Holster for Glock 43/43X/43X MOS](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="klipt-iwb-glock-43-43x-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klipt-iwb-glock-43-43x-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Glock 43 / 43X / 43X MOS as an everyday carry option for a few weeks now, and it has exceeded my expectations. The sleek, discreet design of the holster makes it easy to conceal under clothing without adding bulk or discomfort. I particularly appreciate the high sweat guard that keeps my firearm off my body, preventing any irritation from moisture or slide serrations.

One standout feature is the easy on/easy off belt clip - it securely attaches to belts up to 1. 5" wide and can be removed with ease when needed. Additionally, the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard provide tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is safely secured at all times. Although there are no adjustments needed for built-in retention, which could be a drawback for some users who prefer customization options, I find this aspect convenient and hassle-free.

In terms of daily use, the holster has performed exceptionally well - providing ample comfort without sacrificing security features like smooth edges and full-length sweat guard. As someone who has tried several different IWB holsters over the years, this one stands out as a reliable choice for everyday carry due to its balance of functionality and comfort.

Overall, I highly recommend this Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for anyone in search of an unobtrusive yet secure option for carrying their Glock 43 / 43X / 43X MOS on a daily basis.

### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD 3](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/slide-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Springfield XD 3" extensively, I can confidently vouch for its durability and exceptional build quality. Made from a strong polymer blend, this holster is designed to last. Its IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut ensures quick muzzle clearance, while the precision molded design provides a perfect fit for my firearm.

Although it shares similar features with the Classic OWB Holster at a lower price point, it isn't without its flaws. Some users have reported difficulty in unlocking the secondary lock during action-packed situations like USPSA competitions - an area where improvement could be made in future versions. Additionally, some users noted issues with retention adjustment requiring screws - an easier method could be considered for future models as well.

On the positive side, this holster offers many attachment options to meet various requirements. The positive locking trigger guard also keeps my firearm secure during rigorous training sessions. With its versatile mounting pattern and compatibility with our wide range of attachments, it's no surprise that this holster is a favorite among competitive shooters.

Overall, while there are some areas that could be improved, I still consider this holster to be a reliable option for carrying outside the waistband given its performance relative to its price point.

I recently tried out the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Sig P320C / M18, and it has definitely become a favorite. The slim design is discreet, making it easy to carry every day without feeling too bulky or uncomfortable.

One of the best features is the high sweat guard which keeps my firearm off my body, preventing moisture and slide serration discomfort. Plus, the belt clip is fantastic; it holds my holster securely in place on my belt until I need it.

The built-in retention ensures that my firearm stays secure at all times while giving me peace of mind and tactile feedback when removing the weapon from the holster. The entire holster is one piece, so attaching it to any belt is a breeze – you just clip it on and go!

Comfort-wise, this holster excels with its smooth edges and full-length sweat shield. I can easily wear it all day long without any issues whatsoever while doing physical activities like hiking or running errands around town – no pain points! 😃

My only minor complaint would be adjusting the cant can be tricky sometimes; an adjustable cant option would be great to have for added convenience. However, overall this is a fantastic carrying option that's well worth considering if you own a Sig P320C / M18 like myself! 👍

The USPSA and IDPA legal speed cut makes drawing and holstering my gun fast and efficient, giving me an edge during competitions. And with the optic ready speed cut combined with the positive lock trigger guard, I know my firearm is securely stored at all times. However, like others have mentioned before me, I did struggle with making adjustments on this holster when first using it. But after some trial and error (and persistence), I eventually figured out how to manipulate the screws correctly - so just be aware that there might be a small learning curve.

Overall, while there were a few challenges initially, once you get past that hurdle, this holster is an excellent choice for any serious marksman looking for a high-quality product made in the USA from durable materials that won't let you down when it matters most.
