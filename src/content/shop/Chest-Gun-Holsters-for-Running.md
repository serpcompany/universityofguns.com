When I first got my hands on the Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster, I was instantly impressed by its quality and versatility. This bad boy is perfect for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable way to carry their sidearm.

One thing I really appreciated about this holster is its universal fit. Whether you've got a compact little number or a full-sized beast, this baby can handle it. Plus, with the adjustable design, it fits most body types comfortably.

The padded shoulder harness? Oh man, it's like wearing a cloud. You won't even notice it's there during those long days on the range. The buckle system is super easy to use and allows you to swap around the holster and magazine pouch depending on your dominant hand.

And speaking of the magazine pouch, the inverted design really helps with those lightning-fast reloads. I've honestly never seen anything like it before. The reinforced stitching and seams also give me peace of mind knowing that this holster is built to last, even in the toughest conditions.

However, there is one downside – the vertical belt straps can be a bit cumbersome at times. They do help keep things secure during movement, but they can take some getting used to.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/chest-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=chest-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-gun-holster-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/chest-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=chest-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

Its sturdy design and the secure holsters provide a sense of safety and preparedness, whether I'm hiking in the mountains or fishing by the lake.
