<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=biometric-gun-safes&utm_term=vaultek-nmxi-wi-fi-high-capacity-rugged-smart-safe-biometric-1"><img alt="vaultek-nmxi-wi-fi-high-capacity-rugged-smart-safe-biometric-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-nmxi-wi-fi-high-capacity-rugged-smart-safe-biometric-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the Vaultek NMXi Wi-Fi High Capacity Rugged Smart Safe (Biometric) for several months, I can confidently say that it offers excellent security and convenience. The WiFi feature is incredibly useful; it syncs well with the app on my phone and allows me to track the safe's status.

There are some downsides to consider before purchasing this safe. One notable issue is its battery life; while advertised as lasting up to four months on a single charge under normal use, I found that this was only true if I used the keypad or manual keys for entry rather than the biometric scanner or smart key enabled options. This may be due to higher power draw from these features or possibly just standard battery degradation over time but potential buyers should be aware of this before purchasing this model.

Overall though we recommend considering investment into Vaultek NMXi Wi-Fi High Capacity Rugged Smart Safe (Biometric) given its strong points including user friendly design combined with robust security measures like fingerprint recognition technology built right inside!

### [Multi-Functional Biometric Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=biometric-gun-safes&utm_term=multi-functional-biometric-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/biometric-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=biometric-gun-safes&utm_term=sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20"><img alt="sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20/public"/></a></div>

Sanctuary Platinum's Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe has been a game-changer in my home. The first thing that grabbed my attention was its sleek dark gray metallic finish, which gave a modern and secure look to the space.

The one feature that truly stood out was the biometric lock system. Programming it to recognize up to 100 fingerprints was a breeze, and the fail-safe override keys added an extra layer of security. However, the locking handle did have a slightly wobbly motion, which could be improved for a smoother experience.

The interior was well-lit with an LED light bar, making it easy to access items in the dim lighting of my storage room. The removable glass shelf and dedicated key storage hooks provided ample organization options. And while the safe doesn't have app compatibility or bluetooth connectivity, its primary purpose of secure storage was met without any issues.

During the usage, I did notice a few areas for improvement. The instructions mentioned the need for 4AA batteries, but only the front 9Volt battery was needed. The other two AA cells might be intended for the internal lighting, which this model does not have. Also, the seal around the door seemed a bit uncertain in terms of keeping water out. Adding an extra layer of dessicant beads and a recording hygrometer helped maintain a manageable level of humidity inside.

Overall, Sanctuary Platinum's Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe has proven to be a sturdy, well-made safe that offers great protection for valuables. Its biometric lock system, spacious interior, and attractive design make it a worthwhile investment, despite a few minor hiccups in the overall experience.
