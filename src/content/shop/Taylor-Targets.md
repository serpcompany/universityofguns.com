### [Champion Shooting Rimfire Orange Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-impact-steel-tyl-targets-rimfire-orange-44923c-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-impact-steel-tyl-targets-rimfire-orange-44923c-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Champion Impact Steel TYL Targets Rimfire Orange 44923C in my weekly shooting practice sessions, and I couldn't be happier. As an avid shooter, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and durability of these targets.

Ever since I swapped out my old paper targets for these steel ones, I've noticed a significant boost in my accuracy. The four different sizes (3x1/4, 2.5x1/4, 2x1/4, and 1.5x1/4) make it super easy to practice a variety of shots without getting bored. Plus, the center hole allows me to hang them up on the range with ease.

It's worth mentioning that these targets are specifically designed for 22LR, which means you won't have any trouble using them with your rimfire firearms. One small issue I encountered was that they're made of lead, so proper handling and disposal should be exercised to ensure safety.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Champion Impact Steel TYL Targets Rimfire Orange 44923C. I've seen improvements in my shooting skills since incorporating these targets into my training routine. If you're looking for a reliable and reusable round target, this is definitely worth considering!

### [RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Steel Target: Durable and Efficient Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the Taylor Targets RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Steel Target for some fun shooting sessions with my family and friends. This target is a game-changer! It comes with four lower 3-2/1 in targets and one upper 3-1/2 in target, which adds to the challenge and enjoyment.

What I really love about this target is the rimfire reset feature. Once all four lower targets flip up, hitting the upper target resets them all back into position. This eliminates the need for me to walk back and manually reset my targets, so I can spend more time shooting. The target is designed for use with rimfire handguns and rifles, 0.22 caliber, and provides shooting action that is easy to see and hear.

Made from heavy-duty steel, the RR-53.5 is built to last and provide years of trouble-free practice. The portable and easy-to-reset design means we can take it with us wherever we go, making it perfect for outings with family and friends.

The only small downside I noticed is that the target might not be able to withstand magnum revolver rounds. However, for regular rimfire handguns and rifles, the RR-53.5 is a fantastic choice that combines excitement, challenge, and portability, all in one package. Highly recommended!

### [Durable T-Post Pro Target Kit with 8" Round Target for Rifles and Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cts-targets-cts-t-post-pro-target-kit-with-round-target-size-8-inch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cts-targets-cts-t-post-pro-target-kit-with-round-target-size-8-inch-1/public"/></a></div>

I am genuinely thrilled with my CTS T-Post Pro Target Kit! I've always been a keen shooter, but mounting my targets securely and safely has always been a headache. However, this target kit has completely changed the game for me. The T-Post Pro Target Hanger provides a heavy-duty steel connection that fits perfectly onto standard T-posts. Installing the target was a breeze, and I didn't even need a second person to help me out.

The Round Target included in the kit is just perfect. Made from rugged AR500 steel, it's built to withstand substantial shooting abuse. I've been practicing my rifle skills lately, and the target has been taking punishment after punishment without any signs of wear or tear. This allows me to practice all day, every day, without worrying about damaging the target.

One feature I absolutely love is the heavy-duty powder-coated finish. Not only does this provide a sleek look to the setup, but it also ensures that the entire kit is very resistant to rust and outdoor elements. And the fact that it's pistol and rifle-rated gives me peace of mind knowing that the target will always perform.

However, there's one minor downside that I've come across. It would've been great if the kit included the actual T-post due to the fact that some shooters might not have them readily available. Nevertheless, this minor inconvenience hasn't dampened my enthusiasm for the CTS Targets T-Post Pro Target Kit.

Overall, the CTS T-Post Pro Target Kit with Round Target is a phenomenal addition to my shooting practice sessions. It's incredibly easy to set up and provides a sturdy, safe, and enjoyable shooting experience. If you're considering investing in a high-quality target, I definitely recommend giving this kit a try.

### [Allen EZ Aim IBS 50-Yard Rimfire Target, Pack of 25](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="allen-15582-ibs-rimfire-target-25-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allen-15582-ibs-rimfire-target-25-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Allen 15582 IBS Rimfire Target for quite some time now and I must say, it's a solid choice for any avid shooter or someone looking to improve their long-range rifle accuracy. One of the things I particularly love about this target is how robust the paper feels. It's not your typical thin paper that gets easily damaged or blown away by the wind. No sir! This target is designed for the long haul, making it perfect for regular practice sessions at the range.

Another thing that I found incredibly helpful is the size of the target - 25 packs! That's plenty of shots before needing a new one. And speaking of shooting, these targets are specifically designed for match shooting which makes them perfect for serious competitors or anyone wanting to hone their skills.

However, there's always room for improvement, right? While I found the quality of the paper to be top-notch, setting it up can be a bit challenging due to its size. It may take some time and effort to get it right, but once you've got it in place, it's smooth sailing from there.

All in all, if you're looking for a reliable and durable target system, the Allen 15582 IBS Rimfire Target is definitely worth checking out. You won't be disappointed!

### [Rimfire Animal Target 4-Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/taylor-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-impact-steel-4-pack-animal-targets-rimfire-box-44924c-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-impact-steel-4-pack-animal-targets-rimfire-box-44924c-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Champion Impact Steel Animal Rimfire Targets for a few weeks now and I must say, they've added a whole new level of excitement to my backyard practice sessions. These four different animal targets - Prairie Dog, Coyote, Cougar, and Bear - come in bright orange color which makes them super easy to spot even at longer distances.

The best part about these targets is their size; they're just 7" long, perfect for honing my accuracy with my. 22LR rifle from 50 yards out. And the center hole for hanging? It's perfect! It ensures that each target hangs securely, taking all my shots without getting damaged.

However, there is one minor con. The Gopher target is quite tricky to aim at especially when you're starting at long ranges. But that being said, mastering it has become quite an interesting challenge now!

All in all, if you're looking to add some fun and variety to your rimfire practice sessions, the Champion Impact Steel Animal Rimfire Targets are definitely worth checking out. They're durable, easy to set up, and provide hours of target shooting enjoyment.
