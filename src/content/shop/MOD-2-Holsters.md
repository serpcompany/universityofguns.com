I've been using the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for my CZ Shadow 2 and it has become a reliable companion in my daily carry routine. The adjustable retention feature is a game changer, as it allows me to customize the fit of the holster around my firearm, ensuring that it stays snugly in place throughout the day.

The optic ready speed cut design is another fantastic feature, giving me an edge during competitive situations while still being IDPA & USPSA legal. I appreciate how this holster offers compatibility with Blade-Tech's wide range of Outside the Waistband attachments, allowing me to tailor its draw and ride according to my personal preferences.

Initially, I did face some difficulty tightening or loosening the screws due to them spinning on their posts. However, after following customer support's advice of using rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer, I was able to resolve this issue – although others may find this frustrating. Additionally, some users might desire wider belt loops for added comfort when carrying their weapon.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am overall satisfied with the quality and durability of this holster - made from high strength Boltaron here in the USA - as well as Blade-Tech's lifetime guarantee on craftsmanship issues which provides peace of mind knowing that it will last for years to come.

The slim design also helped to conceal what matters most by sitting closer to my body than ever before. This minimized printing and ensured that my firearm stayed in place as intended while naturally moving with my body.

The positive lock trigger guard was a great feature that provided me with tactile feedback indicating when my firearm was securely in place. And the audible click when reholstering gave me added confidence that my weapon was safely locked in place every time I reholstered it, allowing me peace of mind while carrying it daily or during training sessions.

The Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster for Smith & Wesson Shield 9/40/Plus is an innovative product that offers a versatile and reliable experience. The auto-locking, toolless design with Mod-Lok makes it easy to transition from OWB to IWB carry, and the modular adaptability allows you to choose quick-release Mods that fit your individual needs. It's also great to have the ambidextrous holster design as it accommodates both left and right-handed shooters.

One of the particularly impressive features is the positive lock trigger guard which provides tactile feedback, ensuring that the firearm remains secure at all times.

While they are currently durable through various means, they may eventually fail or break over time.

Overall, this holster earns an A++ for its durability and versatility. Finding a holster that meets these criteria can be challenging, but Blade-Tech manages to deliver with their Total Eclipse 2. 0 Holster for S&W Shield 9/40/Plus.
