### [Official USPSA/IPSC Practice Paper Target, Model: B29](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=official-uspsaipsc-practice-paper-target-model-b29)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=action-target-b29-black-100pk-1"><img alt="action-target-b29-black-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-b29-black-100pk-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've spent countless hours perfecting my aim and technique. Recently, I decided to give Action Target's B29 Black 100pk a try for my home practice sessions. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. The heavy paper and precise printing make each shot feel satisfying and accurate.

The targets are easy to set up and can withstand multiple rounds without falling apart. This means even on those hot summer days when the sweat is pouring down my face, I can maintain my focus on improving my skills. Plus, the compact size of the targets means I can store them easily when not in use.

However, there's one minor downside to these targets – they aren't reactive. While some shooters may prefer this for a more serious practice environment, I do sometimes miss the instant gratification of a pop-up target or the satisfying sound of hitting steel. But overall, the Action Target B29 Black 100pk has been a valuable addition to my training regimen.

Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets, a 19"x25" pack of 100, are the perfect companions for your shooting sessions. As soon as I unpackaged them, I was blown away by how bright and colorful the bold high-contrast silhouette is. The neon red bullseyes make it incredibly easy to see even the tiniest dark bullet holes, making scoring a breeze.

A major highlight of these targets is their lifelike size - half-torso human silhouette, providing an authentic touch to your shooting practice. The scoring zones are thoughtfully designed, with each having a 1" bright-colored center for precise aiming. I also appreciated how each cylindrical scoring ring mirrors the ones found in standard 25-yard handgun qualifying targets, allowing me to incorporate these into my regular training routine.

One thing that sets these targets apart from others is their durability. Despite being made of paper, they held up quite well during multiple shooting sessions. The targets are easy to see from a distance, even in low light conditions, thanks to the bright white silhouette on a black background.

However, there's a minor downside. Although these targets are excellent for indoor use, their size may become challenging to manage in more cramped spaces. But overall, these Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets have given my practice sessions a boost of excitement and precision.

### [Collapsible Folding Paper Target Holder and Stand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=collapsible-folding-paper-target-holder-and-stand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=champion-folding-paper-target-holder-1"><img alt="champion-folding-paper-target-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-folding-paper-target-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

So, imagine this: you're an avid shooter, always on the go, but you don't just want to shoot anywhere without some semblance of order and organization, right? That's where the Champion Folding Target Holder comes in. This little gadget is perfect for shooting enthusiasts who need a portable, lightweight solution to set up paper targets.

When I first tried this out, I was instantly amazed by how easy it is to set up. It's like having a compact, foldable stand that makes shooting on the go a breeze. The specs tell me it's 19.5 wide, 28.5 high (without the target board), and 16 deep, so it's not too bulky but still provides enough stability for your paper targets.

One cool feature is the nylon carrying case with a drawstring closure and shoulder strap. This allows you to transport the target holder hassle-free, whether you're going to a friend's house, a deer camp, or just setting up in your backyard.

Now, it's not all sunshine and roses. There have been some complaints about the frame not being fully lockable, which might cause some wobbliness. However, some users have mentioned that staking it down with a sandbag or two can help stabilize it.

Overall, the Champion Folding Target Holder is a convenient, go-to choice for anyone who wants to set up their paper targets with ease and take shooting on the road. Just remember to bring some stakes or sandbags to keep it secure when the wind picks up.

### [Dirty Bird 3-Gun Nation Splatter Paper Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=dirty-bird-3-gun-nation-splatter-paper-targets)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-paper-targets-17-25-in-3-gun-nation-target-per-101"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-paper-targets-17-25-in-3-gun-nation-target-per-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-paper-targets-17-25-in-3-gun-nation-target-per-101/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a set of Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Paper Targets - perfect for sprucing up my shooting practice. What caught my attention was the intense white splatter feature, which allowed me to spot each of my shots with ease. These non-adhesive back targets can be placed wherever I want on a shooting range, and it's easy to note down any observations on them.

One of the best features of these targets is the 3-Gun Nation design - it comes with two scoring areas, a 17.25-inch secondary or B zone, and an 8-inch primary or A zone. The shooting rules are simple - hitting the A zone once means a neutralized target, while two hits in the B zone count as well.

The Dirty Bird Targets are made of heavy tag board construction, ensuring their durability for multiple shooting sessions. The only issue I found was that they're not reusable, so I need to stock up more often than I'd hoped. Despite this minor inconvenience, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the product. It's perfect for both new and seasoned shooters like myself, providing visibility and challenge to make every shooting session productive and fun.

### [Trouble-Shooter Handgun Target 19"x25" 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=trouble-shooter-handgun-target-19x25-100-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/paper-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=paper-shooting-targets&utm_term=trouble-shooter-handgun-diagnostic-19x25-paper-shooting-targets-100-pack-1"><img alt="trouble-shooter-handgun-diagnostic-19x25-paper-shooting-targets-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/trouble-shooter-handgun-diagnostic-19x25-paper-shooting-targets-100-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had my fair share of struggles with handgun accuracy. The Trouble-Shooter Handgun Diagnostic targets turned out to be my saving grace. These 19"x25" paper targets are packed with 100 units, and they come in vibrant shades of yellow and red. The color contrast, combined with their high-quality paper, makes them incredibly easy to spot on the range.

One of the primary reasons I love these targets is their ability to help identify common shooting mistakes. There are eight detailed diagrams on each target, each representing a different error that shooters often make. After firing a few shots, I would compare my bullet groupings to these diagrams, and in no time, I could pinpoint where I was going wrong. Whether it was a misalignment of my grip or improper trigger control, the Trouble-Shooter made it easy to understand and rectify the issues.

Designed for both right and left-handed shooters, these targets are incredibly versatile. I've used them with a variety of sighting systems, including iron sights and red dot sights, and they have always performed impeccably. The fact that they can be used effectively at distances of 15 feet to 200 yards is just icing on the cake.

There is, however, one downside I've noticed while using these targets. They are made of paper, and as such, they are susceptible to tear and wear. This means I have to be extra careful while removing them from the target holder to avoid damaging them.

In conclusion, the Trouble-Shooter Handgun Diagnostic targets have been an invaluable addition to my shooting practice. They offer a simple and visually effective way to identify and correct common shooting mistakes. Plus, their high-quality construction, affordability, and wide range of applicability make them a must-have for any serious shooter.

One thing that really stood out for me was the quality of the targets. They're made of sturdy cardboard that's tough enough to withstand a few hits. This pack comes with 25 assorted paper targets in different patterns, which were all a lot of fun to shoot at.

However, one downside to these targets is their size. They're quite small, so if you're looking for something larger, these might not be the best for you.

Overall, I had a great time using these paper targets from Daisy, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who's into target shooting or has a bb gun they want to practice with. Just be sure to check out the size before purchasing, as they might be a bit smaller than you expect.

I have been using the Pro-Shot Green Bullseye Target for some time now, and I must say, it has revolutionized my aiming experience. As soon as I started using it, I noticed the vibrant color of the target making it incredibly easy to see and aim, especially when shooting in low light conditions. The heavy paper construction ensures that the target remains intact even after several shots, making it reusable and cost-efficient.

However, while the target itself is excellent, one drawback is that it does not come with an adhesive to stick it to the wall or stand. This might require you to use your own adhesive or support system, which could be a little inconvenient. But, overall, the Pro-Shot Green Bullseye Target is a game-changer for aiming and accuracy, and I can't recommend it enough.

The first thing that caught my eye was the clear vital zones and scoring area, which made aiming and scoring much easier than with traditional targets. The extra aim points on either side of the head proved invaluable during my practice sessions, giving me more opportunities to hone my shot placements. Plus, the bold vital organ outlines provided consistent feedback that helped me understand how to effectively neutralize an assailant.

I also appreciated the fact that these targets are made in the U. S. A. , ensuring that I'm supporting a local business and getting a high-quality product at the same time.
