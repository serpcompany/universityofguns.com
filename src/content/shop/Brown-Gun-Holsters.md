### [Versacarry Compound OWB Holster for Right-Handed Users](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/brown-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/brown-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first received the Versacarry Brown Leather OWB Holster, I was excited to try it out. The first time I used it, I noticed the comfort it provided - the polymer lining truly does make a difference. I found that it fits nicely on my belt, and the open-top allows for quick access to my firearm. The right-handed orientation was perfect for me, but it's worth noting that it might not be the best fit for lefties.

One standout aspect of the Versacarry Brown Leather OWB Holster is its build quality. Being handcrafted in America, you can really tell it's made with care and precision. The combination of water buffalo leather and carbon fiber finish not only looks great but also feels high-quality.

However, one minor issue I experienced was that, after prolonged use, my firearm began to stick slightly to the holster material. This wasn't a significant problem and may just be a case of needing some elbow grease or silicone spray to remedy.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the Versacarry Compound OWB Holster RH Size 1 Brown. Its comfort, right-handed design, and made-in-America craftsmanship are definite highlights. If you're in the market for a new gun holster, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/brown-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-variable-grd-owb-p365-leather-tan-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-variable-grd-owb-p365-leather-tan-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the DeSantis Gunhole Variable GRD Outside Waistband (OWB) Holster and it's been a game-changer. This leather gem, specifically designed for the SIG Sauer P365 and P365XL models, has been my trusty sidekick for concealed carry. As a first-time user of an OWB holster, I was a bit skeptical, but the Variable GRD has absolutely blown me away.

The first thing that caught my eye was its premium saddle leather construction. It's not just about looks - this material is durable and resistant to moisture, ensuring my firearm stays dry even during intense workouts or a hot summer day. The reinforced stitching gives it that added strength, making me feel confident in the holster's stability.

One of the best things about this holster is its adjustability. The Variable GRD is equipped with an adjustable retention strap that allows me to customize the fit of my SIG Sauer P365 to my preference. This feature ensures that my firearm stays secure and stable when I'm on the go. The wide-mouth design is another highlight, making it easy to access my weapon quickly in case of an emergency.

Let's talk comfort. With its low profile design and lightweight leather, this holster is a dream to wear. It's easy to conceal under layers and surprisingly comfortable for extended periods. What more could you ask for?

Compared to other holsters on the market, the DeSantis Gunhole Variable GRD stands out with its superior comfort, adjustability, and durability. It's reliable, efficient, and quite honestly, a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their carry game. My only critique would be that the holster doesn't cater to left-handers, but that's a minor inconvenience. Overall, I'm a happy carrier and would highly recommend this holster to anyone in the market for a reliable OWB leather holster.

### [Adjustable Leather Gun Holster for Small and Sub-Compact Revolvers - Brown - 6.5 Inches](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/brown-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I recently got my hands on the Saddle Mate Leather Gun Holster and it has quickly become an essential part of my daily carry. The 6.5-inch size is perfect for my smaller revolver and fits snugly onto my belt. The first thing that caught my attention was the rich, medium brown color of the top-grain buffalo leather - it's absolutely stunning!

The build quality on this holster is top-notch. Expertly handcrafted, it's clear that each stitch and detail has been carefully considered to create a holster that not only looks good but also performs well. I love how the leather has been green-tanned with fewer chemicals and less water, making it not only eco-friendly but also more durable in the long run.

One feature that really stands out is the adjustable retention strap. It's super easy to adjust and ensures my gun stays securely in place while also allowing for a quick draw when needed. I also appreciate how the snap closure on the strap is designed to be difficult to open – this adds an extra layer of safety when carrying my firearm.

However, there's one issue I did come across. The holster's leather is quite stiff at first, which can make it slightly challenging to draw my gun smoothly. But after breaking it in over time, I'm confident that this will become less of a problem.

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with my Saddle Mate Leather Gun Holster. Its high-quality craftsmanship, stylish design, and reliable performance make it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable and secure way to carry their firearm.

Constructed with high-quality leather, this holster has been a reliable companion whenever I step out on an adventure. The first thing that caught my eye was the intricate detailing on the leather, exuding an old-world charm. While it's not the most lightweight choice out there, the holster's solid construction guarantees durability.

However, during my usage, I did notice some minor inconvenience with the leather - it tends to absorb dirt easily, making it look dirty and stained. Despite this, I've been generally satisfied with the holster's performance. So, if you're looking for a stylish yet functional accessory to complement your western outfit, the Denix Single Western Leather Holster in brown might just be what you need.

However, one minor downside I experienced was the potential for a smaller gun to fit loosely in the holster. Although this is not a significant issue, it might require some adjustment depending on the size of your handgun.
