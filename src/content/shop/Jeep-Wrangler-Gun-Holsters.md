### [Secure IWB Holster Mount for Vehicles, Desk, and Nightstand Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the IWB Holster Mount and have been using it daily for a few weeks now. This product has truly transformed my daily carry experience, offering both convenience and peace of mind. The mount securely holds my holstered firearm in place, whether I'm at my office desk or driving in my truck. Its dual locking design provides assurance that the weapon won't fall out, even on bumpy roads.

One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost! With its lightweight design and dual locking mechanism, you can rest assured that your firearm remains safe and secure while on-the-go or stored away when not needed.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1/public"/></a></div>

As someone who has recently started carrying concealed, I must say that the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack S&W Shield 9/40 & 2.0 Bl! has been quite an exciting introduction to the world of holsters.

The Core Carry Pack is truly a one-stop solution for all my holstering needs. In just minutes, I can transform this little gadget into an IWB (inside waistband) holster, an appendix carry holster, an OWB (outside waistband) belt slide, or even an OWB paddle holster thanks to its modular design. It's kind of like Lego for grown-ups, but with more serious applications!

To accompany this versatile holster, the Core Carry Pack also comes with a bonus Holster Mount which allows me to attach my ShapeShift onto a variety of surfaces within seconds. This is perfect for those days when I need to switch between carrying my gun and not - less hassle, more convenience.

However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The only drawback I experienced with this product was its size. I found the OWB holster to be quite bulky, making it a bit impractical for casual, everyday use. It definitely felt more suitable for professionals like security personnel or law enforcement officers who need to carry their weapons concealed at all times.

Moreover, while the concept of having adjustable retention is a brilliant idea in theory, it can be a bit confusing for users who are new to modular holsters. The thumb release on the holster could also use some improvement as it tends to get stuck occasionally.

Overall, despite these minor issues, I am quite satisfied with my ShapeShift. It offers great flexibility and convenience, making it easy for me to switch between different carrying styles depending on my mood or outfit for the day. For anyone looking to invest in a high-quality modular holster system, I would definitely recommend giving the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack a shot!

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jeep-wrangler-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

I've been using the Great Day QuickDraw Overhead Gun Rack for my Jeep Wrangler and it's been a game-changer. Installing it was a breeze; no drilling or bolts required, just snap it onto the side roll bars and it's good to go. The quick-draw design makes loading and unloading my tactical weapons a breeze. Plus, the aircraft aluminum construction ensures durability without adding too much weight.

One thing that stood out to me was the patented "opposing force" installation system. It's so secure that I don't have to worry about my weapons shifting during rough rides. However, I must admit that the webbing on the straps could use some improvement. They're fine for regular use, but under heavy strain, they don't seem as sturdy as they should be.

All in all, I'm happy with the QuickDraw Overhead Gun Rack. It's made in the USA, which is always a plus, and it fits perfectly into my Jeep Wrangler, giving me ample space to carry my tactical weapons safely. It's a must-have for any Jeep owner who needs secure storage for their gear.

I recently got the chance to try out the Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack for my Jeep Wrangler, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The quick install feature made it incredibly easy to set up, and within minutes, I had a safe and secure place to store my hunting rifles.

The soft, foam-lined gun clips were a major highlight for me. Not only did they provide ample protection for my prized possessions, but they also made it incredibly easy to slide my guns in and out without any scratching or damage. The quick draw Velcro straps are another noteworthy feature, as they make securing your guns a breeze, even while on the go.

The fact that this product is lightweight yet sturdy is a huge plus in my book. I don't have to worry about it weighing down my Jeep or taking up too much space. Plus, the fact that it's made in the USA feels like an added bonus, especially when I know I'm supporting local businesses.

However, one minor con is the price point. While I believe the overall value is there, it might not be within budget for everyone. Another potential issue is the limited compatibility with certain types of rifles, specifically those with longer barrels or muzzle breaks.

Overall, I'm incredibly satisfied with my Great Day Quick Draw Overhead Gun Rack. It's made transporting my hunting gear much more convenient and secure, and I look forward to using it on many more adventures.
