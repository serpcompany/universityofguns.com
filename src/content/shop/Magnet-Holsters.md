### [Smith & Wesson M&P Shield IWB Holster with Adjustable Retention Pressure and Carry Angle](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnet-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnet-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hol-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hol-1/public"/></a></div>

For the past couple of months, I've been using this IWB holster for my S&W M&P Shield 9mm, and it's safe to say both the retention and fit are top-notch. It keeps my weapon secure without any worry of it falling out, which is a big plus. However, when it comes to comfort, the design adds some bulk around the firearm area that can make it slightly uncomfortable at times.

### [Universal Mag Carrier Kydex Concealed Carry IWB Magazine Holster by We The People Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnet-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magnet-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="universal-mag-carrier-kydex-concealed-carry-iwb-magazine-carrier-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-b-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/universal-mag-carrier-kydex-concealed-carry-iwb-magazine-carrier-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-b-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first received my Universal Mag Carrier Kydex Concealed Carry/Holster by We The People Holsters, I was immediately impressed with its quality and design. This carrier is made from durable Kydex material that ensures a secure grip on my magazines, while still allowing for easy access.

One of the standout features for me is the adjustable tension screws which allows me to customize the fit of the magazine within the carrier. With an adjustable cant feature, I can also carry it at different angles which provides great comfort based on my preferred carry position.

This mag carrier has worked well for both single-stack and double-stack mags, as it accommodates both types perfectly. However, one minor downside I've noticed is that if a magazine is inserted too far into the carrier, bullet tips are exposed on some double stack magazines (mainly because they are designed for universal fitment). It's important to ensure your mags are in place correctly before carrying them.

In conclusion, this mag carrier has become an essential part of my everyday carry setup offering excellent concealment and reliability while providing fast accessibility when needed.

Another standout feature is the protective sweat guard that minimizes contact between your gun and your body.

That being said, there are some room for improvements, such as enhancing retention pressure adjustment range and increasing sweat guard height to prevent accidental mag pressure disengagement. Although these could be worked on, overall this product does its job well with some minor drawbacks.

In terms of downsides, I only wish there were more detailed instructions included in the package for those who are not familiar with adjusting settings on these types of holsters. Nevertheless, that does not take away from how pleased I am with this product's performance overall - it truly feels like an extension of my body when carrying my Glock securely near me at all times!
