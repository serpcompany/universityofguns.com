### [RFID-Activated Enclosed Gunlocker for Tactical Rifles and Shotguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=rfid-activated-enclosed-gunlocker-for-tactical-rifles-and-shotguns)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1/public"/></a></div>

The Hornady Rapid Safe AR Gunlocker is a reliable and secure choice for gun storage, providing quick access via RFID devices and a digital keypad. It's made of thick 16 gauge steel with four internal hardened locking lugs, which exceeds ASTM safety standards. The interior has enough space to store up to two tactical rifles or shotguns, accommodating standard optical sights and 30-round magazines.

One downside is that it may not be able to fit rifles with larger scopes due to limited depth clearance when extracting weapons. Additionally, having a hole in the back for running power cords can potentially compromise security, though some may view this as a necessary trade-off for easy setup convenience. Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe AR Gunlocker offers solid protection and ease of use, making it an excellent storage solution for those seeking fast access to their firearms.

### [Cannon 48 Long Gun + 6 Handgun Safe with E-Lock and 45 Minute Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-safe-with-e-lock-and-45-minute-fire-rating)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon TS5934 Gun Safe and have been using it for the past month. Assembly was a bit challenging, so I enlisted some help due to its weight. The size is perfect for my storage needs, as it accommodates 48 long guns and 6 handguns comfortably. The door organization is a nice touch, providing ample space for smaller items. The carpeted interior with black leatherette trim ensures that my valuables are protected from scratches and damage.

The electronic lock and keypad work seamlessly, giving me peace of mind about accessing my safe's content when needed. However, I have concerns about the quality of some components such as the plastic shelf retainer clips which seem flimsy and could potentially break easily over time. Additionally, while the safe is fire-rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, there isn't enough information available on its fire resistance capabilities to give me complete confidence in its ability to protect my belongings in case of a fire.

Overall, this product meets most of my expectations in terms of securing my firearms and other valuable items. Despite minor concerns about component quality and fire resistance information, it serves its purpose well in keeping my possessions safe from potential threats such as thieves or fires.

### [Hornady Rapid Safe Ready Vault with WiFi and RFID Technology](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=hornady-rapid-safe-ready-vault-with-wifi-and-rfid-technology)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=hornady-rapid-safe-ready-vault-w-wifi-1"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ready-vault-w-wifi-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ready-vault-w-wifi-1/public"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using the Hornady Rapid Safe Ready Vault in my household, and it's been quite a game-changer. The neoprene floor mat prevents my long guns from slipping, keeping them secure in an upright position. The digital keypad and mechanical key backup provide me with options for access, while the WiFi feature means I can monitor and control the safe remotely.

One standout feature of this safe is its versatility. The SQUARE-LOK organizing system allows me to configure the gun racks (included) and other SQUARE-LOK accessories to maximize storage for my firearms. Additionally, the backup override keys and RFID technology provide an extra layer of security.

Another great thing about the Rapid Safe Ready Vault is its ability to run on both AC power and batteries, ensuring my firearms are protected 24/7. The adjustable interior shelf and heavy-duty steel construction make it a reliable and sturdy choice for gun storage.

My only concern has been the weight of the product. At 165 lbs, it's not the lightest safe out there. However, given that it's meant for long-term use and keeping my family safe, the heavier weight may actually be a positive thing.

All in all, the Hornady Rapid Safe Ready Vault is a top-notch choice for anyone looking for a secure, reliable, and convenient gun safe.

I recently got my hands on the Hornady Security Dual Lid Lock Box and it has become an essential part of my daily routine. The high-quality, 16-gauge steel housing offered by this lock box provides unparalleled durability and security. I love that it comes with two separate compartments, each with its own lid and keyed alike lock.

One of the highlights that stood out for me was the built-in handle, which makes it incredibly simple to transport my belongings. However, there was a bit of discomfort while using the handle due to the way it was designed. Another feature that grabbed my attention was the premium foam interior, which does an excellent job of keeping my items secure and free of scratches.

Despite its many positive features, there are certain aspects of the lock box that could have been better. For instance, the open backside of the handle can dig into your hand, making it slightly uncomfortable to carry. This was a minor inconvengence which could have been easily avoided.

All in all, the Hornady Security Dual Lid Lock Box is a reliable, sturdy option for those looking for a safe and secure way to store their valuable items while on-the-go. Although it may have a few design flaws, the overall performance of this lock box makes it a worthwhile investment.

### [Alpha Elite Lock Box by Hornady](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=alpha-elite-lock-box-by-hornady)

I've recently started using the Hornady Alpha Elite Lock Box to store my 1911-sized pistols and 4-inch revolvers. The first thing that struck me was how sturdy and well made it felt. This lockbox is made with a solid 16-gauge steel housing, featuring pry-resistant security bands and a dual crossbar latch mechanism. I also appreciate the included 3' steel security cable, which is rated for a robust 1500 lbs.

One of the standout features for me is the patented cable receiver. It allows for maximum storage space within the box, which is a huge plus considering how limited space can be in vehicle storage systems. Speaking of which, this product meets TSA guidelines for air travel and exceeds both ASTM International and CA DOJ safety standards for child safety and theft resistance.

However, there's a minor drawback that I've experienced with the Alpha Elite Lock Box. The cable provided is slightly short for my vehicle use, making it a tad cumbersome to secure properly. Despite this minor inconvenience, I can't deny that the overall quality of the product far outweighs any small issues I've encountered.

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Hornady Lock Box in my daily life, and it has been a game-changer for me when it comes to securing my firearms. As a proud gun owner, I'm always concerned about the safety of my weapons when I'm out and about. Thanks to this lockbox, I can now discreetly and securely carry my firearm in my vehicle without worrying about potential theft, making it the perfect solution for those times when I need to leave it behind.

What really stood out for me was the patented space-saving cable receiver. It provides ample interior space for storing not only my handgun but also other valuables that I need to keep safe. The 16-gauge steel housing also offers incredible protection against pry attempts, giving me peace of mind that my belongings are well-guarded.

However, one aspect of the Hornady Lock Box that left me wanting more was the lack of a customizable interior. A little more room for adjustability would have made it even better for storing different items with varying dimensions.

Nevertheless, the Hornady Large Lock Box has proven to be an essential accessory for any responsible gun owner. Its sturdy build, spacious interior, and secure cable attachment make it a reliable choice for safeguarding your valued firearms and other treasures.

### [Hornady Keypad Vault for Secure Handgun Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hornady-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=hornady-gun-safes&utm_term=hornady-keypad-vault-for-secure-handgun-storage)

I've been using the Hornady Keypad Vault to secure my handgun and other valuables, and I must say, it's been quite an experience. The first thing that stood out to me was its sturdy construction - the 16-gauge steel housing gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are well protected. The programmable 4 to 6 digit keypad code offers added security, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized access.

One of the highlights of this vault is its interior light feature, which is incredibly helpful when trying to locate items in low-light conditions. It also has an automatic spring-assisted lid that pops open for quick and easy access. However, on the flip side, the hinge spring isn't especially strong, and occasionally, the lid will unlock without springing open as it should.

The Keypad Vault comes with a steel security cable that can withstand up to 1,500 pounds of force, providing an extra layer of protection against theft or unauthorized access. Additionally, it features a patented space-saving cable receiver that allows for maximum storage within the vault.

As for any negative aspects, some users have reported issues with the keypad ceasing to work, or difficulty setting up the safe initially. However, I personally did not encounter any such problems during my usage.

I recently got the Hornady Two Gun Keypad - Vault and it's been such a game-changer for me. First off, let me tell you about the size. It's compact, perfect for fitting on a desk or shelf without taking up too much space. The interior light automatically illuminates when opening the safe, making it super easy to find what you're looking for in the dark.

One of the best features of this product is the removable interior shelf. It helps me organize my handguns and other valuable items, keeping everything neat and tidy. Plus, it's made of 16-gauge steel, making it sturdy and strong.

However, there are some downsides worth mentioning. The safe can be a bit difficult to install due to limited mounting options. And speaking of installation, it requires four AAA batteries, which aren't included in the package.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The Hornady Two Gun Keypad - Vault provides ample storage space, is easy to use, and has a well-made design. It may not be as high-tech as some other gun safes out there, but for the price, it's definitely worth considering.

### Important Features of Hornady Gun Safes

When looking for a Hornady Gun Safe, there are several key features to consider. These features will help ensure the safe meets your needs and provides the proper protection for your firearms:

- Fire Protection: A good gun safe should have a rating of at least 30 minutes of fire protection at temperatures up to 1200Â°F. This will help keep your guns safe in case of a house fire or other emergencies.

- Thick Walls and Door: Thicker walls and doors provide more protection against drilling and prying, making it harder for thieves to gain access to your firearms.

- Lock Mechanism: Look for a safe with an electronic or biometric lock mechanism for easy access and added security. This will provide quick access in an emergency while still keeping your guns safe.

### Considerations when Choosing a Hornady Gun Safe

Before buying a Hornady Gun Safe, consider the following factors:

- Size and Capacity: Determine how many firearms you need to store and choose a safe with an appropriate capacity. Be sure to allow for future growth in your firearms collection.

- Budget: Gun safes can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Set a budget that works for you and compare features and prices across different models to find the best value.

### General Advice for Storing Firearms in a Hornady Gun Safe

To maximize the effectiveness of your Hornady Gun Safe, follow these general guidelines:

- Keep the safe locked at all times when not in use. Always lock up your firearms when leaving the house or when you know they won't be needed for an extended period. This will keep them secure and prevent unauthorized access.

- Store ammunition separately from firearms. Store ammunition in a locked container or inside another compartment within the safe, away from the stored firearms.

- Maintain accurate records of your firearms. Keep copies of purchase receipts, manufacturer's manuals, and any modifications made to the firearms. This information may be required if you ever need to file an insurance claim or provide proof of ownership.
