<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cheap-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cheap-gun-holsters&utm_term=byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who loves to carry my Byrna for self-defense, having a comfortable holster that allows me to do so both inside and outside the waistband is a huge plus.

What really stood out to me about this holster is its minimalist design. It's lightweight and slim, making it easy to forget I'm wearing it until I need to access my Byrna. The open-muzzle bottom gives me plenty of room to grab my launcher quickly and securely, which is essential in a self-defense situation.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this holster. Some users have mentioned that it can be difficult to re-holster the launcher, especially after a few uses. Additionally, the magazine release button on some models may stick out too far, causing the magazine to be ejected inadvertently.

Overall, I've been very satisfied with my Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster. Its comfortable design and versatile carry options make it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their Byrna with ease and confidence.

### [Condor Outdoor Tactical Drop Leg Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cheap-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cheap-gun-holsters&utm_term=condor-outdoor-tactical-drop-leg-pistol-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cheap-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cheap-gun-holsters&utm_term=condor-outdoor-tactical-drop-leg-pistol-holster-1"><img alt="condor-outdoor-tactical-drop-leg-pistol-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-tactical-drop-leg-pistol-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

As a first-hand user of the Condor Outdoor Tactical Drop Leg Pistol Holster, I must say it's a reliable and versatile accessory. The single built-in front magazine pouch with its hook-and-loop closure has been the cherry on top of my tactical gear collection.

The holster's adjustability has been its strongest suit. The two adjustable leg straps with quick-release buckles and non-slip rubber lining provide unparalleled stability, even during intense movements. The fact that the straps can be adjusted according to different body types is quite commendable, as it ensures a comfortable fit regardless of the wearer's size.

However, there are certain cons to consider. While the rubber on leg straps is an upgrade, users have pointed out that the holster is not truly universal due to the unadjustable gun sleeve. It seems like it's best suited for full-sized polymer pistols.

Nevertheless, the price has been a significant bonus despite these minor setbacks. For the amount one pays for this holster, the quality and features it provides are definitely worth the cost. So, if you're in search of a tactical, reliable, and comfortable pistol holster, this one is definitely worth considering.

I recently tested the Condor Tactical Ambidextrous Pistol Holster for a roundup review article and had quite the experience. As someone who enjoys outdoor activities and Airsoft games, I appreciated how easy it was to attach this holster to any MOLLE platform, allowing me to carry my Beretta size pistol with convenience and ease. The modular design proved particularly useful, giving me the freedom to use it comfortably for both left and right-hand configurations.

One feature that stood out was the retention system, equipped with a secondary elastic cord, ensuring my weapon stayed secure at all times. Additionally, the inclusion of a single pistol mag pouch was a welcome bonus. While I liked that it came with two removable MOLLE straps, I couldn't help but wish it was a little more adjustable to cater to different users' preferences.

Despite a few cons, such as its inability to accommodate pistols with a dot on the slide and the missing accessories that would have made this product more versatile, I found the Condor Tactical Ambidextrous Pistol Holster to be a solid choice for airsoft gun aficionados looking for an affordable yet reliable holster solution.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cheap-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cheap-gun-holsters&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-gun-holster-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cheap-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cheap-gun-holsters&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

I've been using this little Glock Sport/Combat Holster for quite some time now, and I have to say it's a game-changer for those who carry a Glock pistol. It's got a polymer construction that makes it incredibly lightweight, perfect for off-duty or plain clothes use. I find it especially useful when I need to conceal my GLOCK beneath a coat or jacket.

One of the features that stood out for me was its special trigger guard retention device. It securely holds my pistol in place, giving me peace of mind throughout the day. The ambidextrous design also ensures it can be used by both left- and right-handed shooters, adding to its versatility.

As for the downsides, the minimalistic design might not be everyone's cup of tea. However, if you're all about functionality and cost-effectiveness, then this holster won't disappoint. Plus, its compatibility with various belt widths and a wide range of Glock pistols makes it an excellent choice for any concealed carry aficionado. And did I mention the quick shipping from Natchez? I've been very impressed with how fast I receive my order every time.

All in all, the Glock Sport/Combat Holster has become a staple in my collection. It's perfect for my daily needs, and I can't imagine switching to anything else anytime soon.
