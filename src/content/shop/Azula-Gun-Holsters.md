The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster has truly lived up to its reputation when it comes to my Springfield XD-M 5. 25". Constructed with a strong proprietary mix of polymers, the durability and rigidity are top-notch.

Overall, I highly recommend this product as it has provided fast draw capabilities and secure retention during intense training sessions and competitions alike, making it reliable and durable in construction at the same time!
