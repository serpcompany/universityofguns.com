As a frequent shooter, I recently had the opportunity to test out the DuraSeal self-sealing target from Champion. The first thing that stood out to me was how lightweight it was, being 80% lighter than metal targets. This made it incredibly easy to transport and set up in various locations.

One unique feature of this target is its wobble upon impact – when you hit it, you get immediate feedback without having to look through binoculars or a spotting scope. However, one drawback I noticed was that there could be more variety in target shapes available within this product line.

Overall, I found my experience with this DuraSeal target from Champion to be enjoyable and efficient due to its portability and auto-resetting functionality.

### [Self-Healing Zombie Targets for Archery Practice (5.5" Diameter)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=zombie-targets&utm_term=self-healing-zombie-targets-for-archery-practice-55-diameter)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/zombie-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=zombie-targets&utm_term=self-healing-targets-5-5-diameter-simpleshot-1"><img alt="self-healing-targets-5-5-diameter-simpleshot-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/self-healing-targets-5-5-diameter-simpleshot-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the 5. 5" diameter Self Healing Targets from SimpleShot for several months, and they have become an indispensable part of my target practice routine. The Zombie design adds an element of fun to the experience, making it more enjoyable. These targets are quite durable and hold up well even after multiple rounds, thanks to the self-healing feature that ensures they last longer than traditional paper ones.

The size of these targets is perfect for my range setup, as it's not too small that it becomes frustratingly difficult to hit, but also not too large that it feels like a waste of ammunition. However, there are a few downsides to these targets: initially setting them up can be challenging and requires patience while figuring out proper mounting techniques. Additionally, the colors fade quickly after several uses leaving them looking duller over time which could affect your aim in low light conditions if not replaced often or kept under direct sunlight exposure more than necessary during storage periods between sessions (if applicable).

Nevertheless, I would still recommend giving this product a try if you enjoy recreational or competitive target shooting due to its consistent performance across multiple trips out on the range. Just make sure to factor in some time for learning how to set them up properly and consider replacing them frequently if color fading becomes an issue in your specific use case.
