<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cannon-48-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon TS5934 Gun Safe and have been using it for the past month. Assembly was a bit challenging, so I enlisted some help due to its weight. The size is perfect for my storage needs, as it accommodates 48 long guns and 6 handguns comfortably. The door organization is a nice touch, providing ample space for smaller items. The carpeted interior with black leatherette trim ensures that my valuables are protected from scratches and damage.

The electronic lock and keypad work seamlessly, giving me peace of mind about accessing my safe's content when needed. However, I have concerns about the quality of some components such as the plastic shelf retainer clips which seem flimsy and could potentially break easily over time. Additionally, while the safe is fire-rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, there isn't enough information available on its fire resistance capabilities to give me complete confidence in its ability to protect my belongings in case of a fire.

Overall, this product meets most of my expectations in terms of securing my firearms and other valuable items. Despite minor concerns about component quality and fire resistance information, it serves its purpose well in keeping my possessions safe from potential threats such as thieves or fires.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-48-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cannon-48-gun-safes&utm_term=liberty-safe-usa-48-60-min-gun-safe-textured-black-1"><img alt="liberty-safe-usa-48-60-min-gun-safe-textured-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-usa-48-60-min-gun-safe-textured-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Liberty Safe USA 48 60 Min Gun Safe, and I must say it's one of the best choices I've made for securing my valuables. The textured black finish adds a sleek touch to my home decor while ensuring that my firearms are protected from theft, fires, and even curious little hands.

The 60 minutes of certified fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit has given me peace of mind knowing my prized possessions won't be damaged by heat or smoke, thanks to the Palusol door seal. And speaking of security, this safe can withstand an impressive 15,300 pounds of pry force and even relocks itself if someone tries to force their way in – talk about tough!

One thing that stands out to me is how well-built this safe is, made entirely from American-made steel and constructed right here in the USA. It gives me confidence knowing my weapons are stored safely and securely.

However, there are a couple of downsides as well. For starters, it's quite heavy, weighing in at over 700 pounds, so moving it around requires some extra help. Additionally, I experienced some minor inconvenience during assembly due to the lack of detailed instructions.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Liberty Safe USA 48 60 Min Gun Safe. While there are a few drawbacks like weight and assembly instructions, the quality and security it offers make up for these minor issues. Highly recommended for anyone looking to protect their valuable possessions!

I recently had the pleasure of investing in a SureLock Security Cadet 48 Gun and Home Safe, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase! From the moment I unboxed this beauty, I was blown away by its sheer size and capabilities.

What immediately stood out to me was the adjustable three-shelf interior which made organizing my possessions a breeze. Additionally, the inclusion of the door panel, allowing me to securely store smaller items such as keys or passports added a level of convenience not typically seen in gun safes.

However, what truly stole my heart (and rightfully so) was the sheer security this bad boy offers. SureLock's Gen II Cadet 48 boasts a 14-gauge steel build, 1.25-inch bolts, and a digital lock with key backup, providing peace of mind that my valuables are safe and secure. Moreover, the thoughtfully designed fire rating of 45 minutes at 1400F ensures protection from fires - a feature that really makes me feel at ease.

The only downside I found was the color scheme - while I love the mocha exterior finish, the desert sand accents aren't exactly my taste. Nonetheless, this little design quibble does little to detract from the overall quality and performance of this safe.

In conclusion, the SureLock Security Cadet 48 Gun and Home Safe has exceeded all of my expectations. It's a reliable, spacious, and secure solution for anyone looking to safely store their possessions. Highly recommend!

One aspect that impressed me was the interior door panel. It's perfect for storing smaller items like handguns and accessories. The 3-point chrome handle coupled with a tool-resistant lock provides swift access while ensuring utmost security.

However, not everything is perfect. The digital keypad, in particular, could use some improvement. It feels a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the safe. Additionally, despite its capacity to hold 48 guns, I found fitting larger long rifles with scopes to be quite challenging.

In conclusion, the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe offers ample storage and robust security features. Though it may have some minor drawbacks, overall, it's a reliable choice for anyone looking to secure their firearms. Plus, knowing it's made right here in the USA just adds to its appeal!
