The Solid locking retention system offers a tactile "click" when my gun is securely in place, providing an added layer of confidence that my firearm will stay put even during rigorous activities. The proprietary molds and CNC-milled design mean that this holster is made with precision, translating into a higher level of comfort and concealment than I've experienced with other Kydex holsters.

I've been using this custom-made Kydex holster from C&G Holsters for several weeks now, and I must say, it's definitely made a difference in my shooting experience. Not only is it extremely durable, but it also allows for a quick draw - both of which are essential features that any competitive shooter requires.

One thing that really stands out about this holster is how well it's made. The Kydex material is of high quality, ensuring that my weapon stays securely in place until I need it. Additionally, the adjustable retention screw provides extra flexibility, making it easier to tailor the holster to my specific needs.

However, there's one downside worth mentioning. The Kydex material, although strong, can be a bit thin in some areas. This makes it feel slightly less sturdy than other holsters I've used in the past. But overall, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the holster's overall performance.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and customizable option for your competition holster needs, then I'd highly recommend giving C&G Holsters a try. Their products are well-made, versatile, and backed by excellent customer service. You won't be disappointed!
