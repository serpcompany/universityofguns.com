Overall, I recommend the Birchwood Casey Qualifier Spinner Target to all rimfire shooters looking for a challenging and entertaining practice tool. Just remember to keep it on relatively dry, hard ground for the best performance.

One of the standout features of this target is its 3/8" thick steel paddles. They not only make the spinner more robust but also ensure that it can handle even the most powerful handguns up to. 44 Magnum caliber. However, as some reviewers mentioned, it's not designed for rimfire usage, so keep that in mind if you plan on using it with a rimfire firearm.

### [Durable Gong Spinner Target for Outdoor Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/shooting-spinner-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-duraseal-double-gong-spinner-target-1/public"/></a></div>

Moreover, the spinner mechanism provides an instantaneous reward for hitting your mark, as the target spins upon impact for all to see.

However, like any product, there are some minor drawbacks. For instance, the spinner sometimes doesn't spin as freely as I'd like, requiring a few extra taps here and there to get it back to its full rotation. Additionally, I feel that the target could benefit from more color options, as the current ones (red and yellow) can easily blend into one another when viewed from far away.

In conclusion, the DuraSeal Double Gong Spinner Target has provided me with countless hours of enjoyment at the gun range. Its innovative self-sealing material, lightweight design, and interactive spinner feature make it a worthy addition to any shooting enthusiast's gear arsenal. While there's room for improvement in terms of color selection and spinner mechanism, this product has earned its spot as one of my favorite shooting targets.
