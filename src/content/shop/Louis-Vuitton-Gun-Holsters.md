### [Comfortable Handmade OWB Holster for Perfect Fit](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vedder-holsters-lightdraw-owb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-lightdraw-owb-1/public"/></a></div>

After trying out several OWB holsters, I finally discovered the LightDraw OWB Holster, and it has become my top choice for concealed carry. Its handmade molded design ensures a perfect fit for my gun, making it easy to comfortably carry throughout the day. The lightweight nature of this holster is a game-changer, as I no longer feel weighed down while carrying.

One feature that sets this holster apart from others is its adjustable retention. It offers just the right amount of security to keep my pistol in place, without hindering a smooth draw when needed. Moreover, despite daily use over an extended period of time, the durability of both the holster itself and its belt loops remains intact - accommodating up to 1. 75" wide belts with ease.

Although this product does have some minor drawbacks such as limited color options or lacking additional accessories like magazine holders or spare parts, overall it excels in providing both comfort and functionality for concealed carry enthusiasts like myself who value these attributes in an OWB holster.

### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 W Light Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon holster and I've been using it with my P320C/M18 light-bearing handgun. The first thing that caught my attention was its sleek, modern design. It's made of polymer, which gives it a solid feel without adding unnecessary weight.

One of the highlights for me is its ambidextrous configuration. Whether I'm wearing it as an inside-the-waistband (IWB) or outside-the-waistband (OWB), this holster adapts seamlessly. It's optimized for appendix carry, which is my preferred method of concealed carry, and it even comes with an appendix carry wing for extra concealment.

Another feature that I appreciate is the holster's compatibility with compact lights. As someone who often trains in low-light conditions, this is a must-have feature for me. Additionally, the optic cut accommodates most optics except for the SRO, making it versatile for various gun setups.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The belt clips and hardware were missing from my package, making the holster unusable until I can get those components. Additionally, the retention is quite tight even when the screws are loosened. This can make drawing the firearm more challenging than I'd like.

Despite these cons, I'm overall pleased with the Alien Gear Photon holster. Its build quality is impressive, and its versatility and adaptability make it a useful addition to my collection of concealed carry holsters.

### [Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for Ruger LCP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster, specifically designed for the Ruger LCP. To be honest, I was hesitant at first because I've had holsters that didn't fit well or felt uncomfortable. But this one pleasantly surprised me.

First off, it's made incredibly light and tough, making it very comfortable to wear. It also has a secure belt-mount mechanism that ensures my gun stays put. The holster gets its durability from 600-denier nylon, which offers four layers of protection including a brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed-cell foam.

Now, while I've had no issues with the holster being loose or floppy, some reviewers did mention that. However, this might be due to individual differences or the type of gun being carried.

One feature that I found incredibly convenient is the adjustability. The straps are fully adjustable and connect with velcro to the holster. These adjustments allow for a snug fit, making me feel secure when carrying my Ruger LCP.

Despite these positives, I did encounter one problem. The straps can be a bit difficult to adjust, especially when trying to slide one side of the Velcro strap through a tight opening. This could potentially lead to damaging the holster if not done carefully.

All in all, I've been quite satisfied with the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster. It's light, tough, and secure, and its adjustability has ensured a comfortable fit for me. The adjustment issue can be a bit frustrating, but this seems to be a one-off problem and not representative of the holster's overall quality.

### [Springfield XDM Elite OSP Tactical WML Kydex Holster - Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-m-elite-osp-x300-owb-tactical-kydex-holster-quickship-right-hand-x300u-t-a-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-m-elite-osp-x300-owb-tactical-kydex-holster-quickship-right-hand-x300u-t-a-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the C&G's Quickship RightHand / X300U/T-A Tactical Gun Holster for my Springfield XDm Elite OSP 9mm, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. Despite having numerous other holsters, this one stands out for its perfect fit, excellent durability, and quick shipping, not to mention the amazing customer service.

Being a tactical Kydex holster, it provides a solid locking retention that gives a audible and tactile “click” when securely holstered, which is quite reassuring. The custom C&G 1.75" Belt Loops ensure a perfect fit, making it incredibly comfortable to wear and conceal. And the fact that it's made in America by veterans and law enforcement personnel really speaks to its quality.

One of the features that I particularly love is its compatibility with various RMR/Red Dots on the market, making it a versatile choice for those with different optical setups. Another thing that I appreciate is its open bottom design, which allows it to accommodate threaded barrels and compensators.

On the flip side, I did find the adjustment for the pistol grip to be a tad loose for my liking, but that's a minor complaint compared to the overall great experience I've had with this holster.

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the C&G Quickship RightHand / X300U/T-A Tactical Gun Holster to any of my peers. It's truly a top-notch holster that offers unbeatable quality, comfort, and convenience, and it's definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a reliable and durable holster for your Springfield XDM Elite OSP.

### [Compatible with Smith & Wesson M&P / M2.0 4.25" / M2.0 4" Compact 9/40 Open Carry Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/louis-vuitton-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-carbon-fiber-left-hand-owb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-m2-0-4-25--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-carbon-fiber-left-hand-owb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-m2-0-4-25--1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P / M2.0 4.25" / M2.0 4" Compact 9/40, and it's been a game-changer. The fit is perfect, and the adjustability makes it comfortable and secure. I've tried both appendix and strong side carry, and it works seamlessly with both.

One feature that stands out is the Kydex material. It's super durable and doesn't rot like leather holsters can. Plus, it's waterproof and washable, which is a must for me.

However, there's one downside. Some users have reported issues with the pivot point between the holster and belt. I personally haven't encountered this problem, but it's something to keep an eye on.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The We The People Holster provides effective concealment, quick access, and a comfortable fit for all-day carry. It's definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a new holster.
