### [Versacarry 1911 OWB Holster, Right-Handed](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=scan-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-1911-owb-holster-right-handed)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=scan-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-compound-owb-holster-size-2-1911-brown-c2212-3"><img alt="versacarry-compound-owb-holster-size-2-1911-brown-c2212-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-compound-owb-holster-size-2-1911-brown-c2212-3/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Versacarry Compound OWB Holster (the one they call "Brownie") for my 1911, and I must say, it's been a game changer. The water buffalo leather is a nice touch, giving that added softness and comfort while keeping everything safely in place. If you're right-handed, this is your guy. The raised protective backing and metal inlay make it feel sturdy yet flexible.

While the stitching is not perfect, it doesn't hinder the overall experience. The fact that it's made in America is a huge plus. For those with a 1911, this is a holster worth considering. Overall, the comfort, reliable construction, and American-made quality make this a worthwhile investment.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=scan-gun-holsters&utm_term=guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2"><img alt="guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/guardian-holster-owb-brown-size-2/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Guardian Holster by Versacarry and it has become my go-to accessory for concealed carrying of my weapon. The moment I held it, I could feel the quality of the handcrafted Water Buffalo leather. It instantly conforms to my waistline, offering an incredibly comfortable fit that's barely noticeable under clothing.

The Guardian Holster is designed for most double stacked semi-automatic pistols with a 4" barrel, which suits my needs perfectly. The distressed brown finish adds a rugged touch to its appearance while ensuring durability. I also appreciate how versatile this holster is, allowing me to secure my weapon in different ways through its unique design.

One downside I experienced was that it took a little bit of adjustment to find the perfect fit for my waist - it wasn't as "one size fits all" as I initially thought. However, once I figured out the right spot, it became very comfortable to wear throughout the day.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my Guardian Holster. Its high-quality leather construction, snug fit, and unique design make it a reliable and discreet option for concealed carrying. If you're in the market for a new holster, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scan-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=scan-gun-holsters&utm_term=alaska-guide-creations-holster-kryptek-highlander-1"><img alt="alaska-guide-creations-holster-kryptek-highlander-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alaska-guide-creations-holster-kryptek-highlander-1/public"/></a></div>

As a frequent hiker, I've always struggled with carrying my sidearm securely and conveniently. That's where the Alaska Guide Creations Holster came in. This nifty little gadget is not only incredibly versatile but also incredibly comfortable to use.

The best part about this holster is its ability to attach to almost anything - my hiking pack, my everyday belt, even my car's seatbelt. The custom laser cut design lets me use it in both right and left-hand configurations, which is a godsend for someone like me who's often swapping hands depending on the terrain.

One of the key features that stood out for me was its adjustability. It perfectly fitted my compact autos and snub-nose revolvers without any problem. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-end design, it's only suitable for pistols with a barrel length of less than six inches from the front of the grip.

Another aspect I appreciated was how the holster came with two Gate Keepers. These little clips ensure that the holster stays securely in place no matter what kind of adventure I'm embarking on. And speaking of adventures, the fact that this holster is made in the USA gives me an extra level of confidence in its quality and durability.

In terms of cons, there are no major faults to report. However, some users might find the lack of specific sizing options for different gun models a bit inconvenient. But as long as you follow the provided measurements, you shouldn't have any issues.

Overall, I've found the Alaska Guide Creations Holster to be a reliable and comfortable addition to my gear. Its flexibility and adjustability make it a must-have for anyone who needs quick access to their sidearm while exploring the great outdoors. Highly recommended!

As an avid gun enthusiast, I recently decided to give the DeSantis Mini Scabbard holster a try. I've always had my eye on products from DeSantis Gunhide, so I was excited to see their take on the scabbard style. Here's my take on this sleek and minimalistic design after putting it through its paces.

At first glance, the Mini Scabbard looks like a stripped-down version of a traditional scabbard, but don't let its simplicity fool you. It's reduced to the bare essentials and yet offers a secure grip on my Sig P365. The exact molding in this holster ensures a snug fit, while the adjustable tension device further enhances its secure hold.

One of the things I really appreciated was how well this holster accommodated my belt, fitting belts up to 1 3/4" wide with ease. And if you prefer a different look or feel, you can find the Mini Scabbard in both black and tan unlined leather options.

However, it's worth mentioning that some models don't come with an adjustable tension device, which might be a concern if you were relying on that feature. Additionally, although the Mini Scabbard provides excellent concealment, depending on your body shape or clothing choices, you might find that accessing your firearm is a slightly more involved process.

Overall, the DeSantis Mini Scabbard holster offers a unique and minimalistic design that provides both security and concealment for my Sig P365. Despite the lack of adjustable tension device on some models and the occasional difficulty in accessing the weapon, I'd still recommend it to fellow gun enthusiasts.

I have been using the Bravo Concealment BCA OWB Holster for my Sig P365 XL, and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of holsters. This holster boasts an exceptional design that provides ample comfort and convenience every time I carry my weapon. The 1.5" injection molded belt loops not only offer robust support but also allow me to adjust the cant for optimal concealment.

One feature that stands out to me is the smooth pocket that ensures a secure and audible click when reholstering. This provides me with the peace of mind that my gun is safe and locked in place, even during quick draw situations.

However, one minor drawback I encountered is that the edges on the holster can be a bit sharp initially. But after using it for a while, the edges wear in and become more comfortable.

All in all, the Bravo Concealment BCA OWB Holster has made concealed carry more comfortable and efficient for me. Its precise fit, adjustable cant, and secure locking mechanism make it one of the best OWB holsters on the market.
