<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=blade-tech-klipt-in-the-waistband-sig-p365-holster-1"><img alt="blade-tech-klipt-in-the-waistband-sig-p365-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blade-tech-klipt-in-the-waistband-sig-p365-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Sig P365, and have been quite impressed with its performance. The slim design makes it easy to conceal, even when wearing light clothing. One of the most significant features is the high sweat guard, which keeps my firearm off my body and prevents any discomfort from moisture or slide serrations.

The belt clip that comes with the holster is an innovative addition; it allows you to secure it in place on your belt up to 1. 5" until you need to remove it, a feature that I have found very useful. Additionally, I really appreciate the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard - these provide tangible feedback to ensure that my firearm is securely stored in place.

Overall, this product exceeded all expectations; it is comfortable throughout the day as well as providing peace of mind knowing that my firearm is securely tucked away until needed. This holster has become a go-to in my EDC routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable IWB option for their Sig P365 / P365X!

### [IWB Kydex Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=iwb-kydex-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-shield)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this Kydex holster for my concealed carry needs and have been using it daily. One of the standout features of this holster is its precise fit for my specific gun model, providing me with an audible click when I securely holster my gun, giving me peace of mind that it's held in place safely.

The quality of the Kydex material is impressive, as it is durable, waterproof, and lightweight. I also appreciate the adjustable retention feature which allows me to customize the holster according to my preferences. The fully adjustable design makes it easy to change the carry angle or position without having to purchase a new holster entirely.

However, there are a few areas where I believe this product could improve further. For example, when carrying appendix style with the optional claw attachment, printing can still be an issue even after adjusting various settings on the claw itself. Additionally, although most reviews report solid construction some customers have experienced minor issues such as screws loosening over time so it's worth noting these potential drawbacks before making your purchase decision!

Overall this Kydex Holster from Odin offers good value for money considering its lifetime guarantee against defects along with other great features like being waterproof and offering a precise fit for your specific gun model.

### [Slim and Discreet IWB Holster for Sig P320C and M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=slim-and-discreet-iwb-holster-for-sig-p320c-and-m18)

I recently tried out the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Sig P320C / M18, and it has definitely become a favorite. The slim design is discreet, making it easy to carry every day without feeling too bulky or uncomfortable.

One of the best features is the high sweat guard which keeps my firearm off my body, preventing moisture and slide serration discomfort. Plus, the belt clip is fantastic; it holds my holster securely in place on my belt until I need it.

The built-in retention ensures that my firearm stays secure at all times while giving me peace of mind and tactile feedback when removing the weapon from the holster. The entire holster is one piece, so attaching it to any belt is a breeze – you just clip it on and go!

Comfort-wise, this holster excels with its smooth edges and full-length sweat shield. I can easily wear it all day long without any issues whatsoever while doing physical activities like hiking or running errands around town – no pain points! 😃

My only minor complaint would be adjusting the cant can be tricky sometimes; an adjustable cant option would be great to have for added convenience. However, overall this is a fantastic carrying option that's well worth considering if you own a Sig P320C / M18 like myself! 👍

### [Adjustable Glock 19 IWB Kydex Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=adjustable-glock-19-iwb-kydex-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=glock-19-19x-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-green-ink-swirl-kydex-adjustable-sec-1"><img alt="glock-19-19x-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-green-ink-swirl-kydex-adjustable-sec-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glock-19-19x-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-green-ink-swirl-kydex-adjustable-sec-1/public"/></a></div>

After using this Glock 19 IWB holster for a while, I found it to be a reliable choice for concealed carry.

One of my favorite features is the adjustable retention, allowing me to personalize the tension according to my liking. Additionally, the ride and cant can be adjusted for maximum flexibility in carrying positions.

The sweat guard does an excellent job of minimizing contact between my gun and body while wearing it. The belt clip holds the holster securely in place and doesn't move or dislodge even when I'm on the go. However, some users have reported issues with their claw arm cracking during installation when carrying in an appendix position.

In terms of comfort, this Glock 19 IWB holster provides adequate support but could benefit from improvements specifically tailored towards extra comfort while seated or driving long distances as some users have mentioned discomfort when sitting for extended periods or driving long distances without compromising on concealability.

Overall, this is a solid product with plenty of useful features such as adjustability and secure attachment methods that make it suitable for many individual needs and preferences when carrying concealed firearms daily - though there are still areas where refinement can be made regarding its fitness for long-term use while seated or driving long distances without compromising on comfort levels experienced by those who choose such usage patterns frequently throughout their day-to-day routines alike too!

### [Universal Mag Carrier Kydex Concealed Carry IWB Magazine Holster by We The People Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/kryptek-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=kryptek-holsters&utm_term=universal-mag-carrier-kydex-concealed-carry-iwb-magazine-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters)

When I first received my Universal Mag Carrier Kydex Concealed Carry/Holster by We The People Holsters, I was immediately impressed with its quality and design. This carrier is made from durable Kydex material that ensures a secure grip on my magazines, while still allowing for easy access.

One of the standout features for me is the adjustable tension screws which allows me to customize the fit of the magazine within the carrier. With an adjustable cant feature, I can also carry it at different angles which provides great comfort based on my preferred carry position.

This mag carrier has worked well for both single-stack and double-stack mags, as it accommodates both types perfectly.

It's important to ensure your mags are in place correctly before carrying them.

In conclusion, this mag carrier has become an essential part of my everyday carry setup offering excellent concealment and reliability while providing fast accessibility when needed.
