My kids particularly enjoyed playing together in teams to see who could score the most points, making it a perfect bonding activity.

While I found the sound level to be sufficient for my needs, some users may find it overwhelming at times. It's important to note that this can be adjusted or turned off altogether, depending on personal preferences. Additionally, the target is quite durable and can withstand constant use without losing any of its features or functions.

The VTAC Double Sided Paper Marksmanship/Silhouette Targets have quickly become a go-to for my shooting practice sessions. The standout feature of this product is its versatility, with two different target styles on one sheet. This space-saving design saves me money and allows for easy transitions between marksmanship and self-defense training.

I like the extra heavy sheet of bright white paper that makes the targets durable and highly visible even in tough conditions. On one side of the target, there's a silhouette with a visible skeleton which helps me accurately work on shot placement for self-defense purposes. On the other side, there are 40 SR-1C bull's-eye targets with a 1" square sighting grid layout - perfect for honing accuracy skills when using handguns or long guns at varying distances.

The life size silhouettes make these targets ideal for realistic practice scenarios, helping to prepare me for various situations I might encounter in real life.
