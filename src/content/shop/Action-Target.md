My kids particularly enjoyed playing together in teams to see who could score the most points, making it a perfect bonding activity.

While I found the sound level to be sufficient for my needs, some users may find it overwhelming at times.

The VTAC Double Sided Paper Marksmanship/Silhouette Targets have quickly become a go-to for my shooting practice sessions. The standout feature of this product is its versatility, with two different target styles on one sheet. This space-saving design saves me money and allows for easy transitions between marksmanship and self-defense training.

I like the extra heavy sheet of bright white paper that makes the targets durable and highly visible even in tough conditions.
