I started using the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System recently and found it to be one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've used so far. The holster material, aeroprene, is incredibly soft and breathable, making it great for wearing all day even in hot weather. I have tested its versatility by carrying my pistol both under an untucked shirt and higher up under my left arm to mimic a shoulder carry, with the belt loop providing excellent retention for a secure fit.

What impressed me about this product was its ability to accommodate any size pistol and any size Inside-the-Waistband (IWB) holster. My experimentation with various holsters on the belly band has proven that this product can cater to different preferences and body types very well – thanks to its hook-and-loop adjustable fit feature.

Overall, I would highly recommend the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System for anyone in search of an adaptable concealed carry solution that provides comfort without compromising security. Its combination of versatility, ease of use, and breathable material makes it stand out amongst similar products in the market today.

As someone who's been using this Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster for a while now, I can tell you it's a game-changer. It's versatile and comfortable, perfect for activities like walks, jogs, hikes, bike rides, and even everyday use. The 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day carrying comfort, and the breathable open-air weave keeps you cool and dry.

One of the best features is the Hard Laminate Trigger Shield. It protects your trigger from accidental discharges, ensuring safety at all times. The elastic pockets are also a standout feature. They're perfect for keeping spare mags, knives, flashlights, and pepper spray handy. The secure YKK zippered storage pockets are another bonus. They're great for stashing your ID, cash, and keys, and even doubles as a phone holder.

Now, the holster is compatible with all sorts of firearms, making it a perfect choice for both left and right-handed individuals. Additionally, the adjustable size means it can fit waist sizes ranging from 26" to 52", covering most body types.

### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [TheCHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=thecheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1"><img alt="cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1/public"/></a></div>

When it comes to my everyday carry, being able to secure my firearm discreetly and comfortably is a top priority. That's why I decided to give the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster a try. I'm not one for flashy options, so the Gun Sox in black really caught my eye.

From the moment I put it on, I was impressed by the smooth draw and the fact that there was no shifting or sliding down my leg. It was so comfortable that I forgot I was carrying my firearm, which is a huge plus for me.

One feature that stood out was the proprietary Pant Protector. This little addition prevented any damage to my pant leg fabric from the gun sight, which was a nice surprise.

However, I did have one issue with the product - it wasn't true to size, so I had to return it. Despite this minor inconvenience, I believe that the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster is definitely worth considering for anyone looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their small to mid-sized firearms.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-gun-holster-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

### [Versacarry Distressed Brown OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=versacarry-distressed-brown-owb-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/womens-gun-holsters-for-running?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=womens-gun-holsters-for-running&utm_term=versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1"><img alt="versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

Finding the perfect holster can be a daunting task, but the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made it an enjoyable experience for me. As someone who carries a full-sized 1911, I was initially skeptical about how concealable it would be. However, the forward cant design ensures the gun stays tight against my body, while the raised protective backing provides both comfort and protection.

One of the things that stood out for me was the unique leather material; made from premium water buffalo leather, it's not only durable but also breaks in incredibly fast. I'm also thrilled with the right-handed draw feature which suits my dominance perfectly. The fact that it's handcrafted in the USA and backed by a lifetime warranty just adds more value to this already amazing product.

However, one minor con is that there could be more size options to cater to various types of guns. But with the available sizes fitting most compact, full-sized, and subcompact handguns, it is still a versatile choice for many.

All in all, the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made concealed carry comfortable and secure for me. It's truly a best buy for the money! "

I recently tried out Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster (Black, Size 16, Right Hand). This little guy is perfect for those looking for a discreet holster that won't draw attention while out and about. The super soft knit fabric lies comfortably against your skin, making it great for prolonged use.

One of the highlights of this product is its adjustable straps. I found them very helpful, especially when it came to getting the right fit. Another nice feature is its adjustable retention strap which keeps your firearm in place firmly yet comfortably.

However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I did struggle with the fact that the straps are not adjustable enough, causing some discomfort during long hours of use. Additionally, I noticed that the holster tends to slide down my leg, which can be quite inconvenient.

All in all, if you're looking for a holster that offers good concealment and comfort, Uncle Mike's Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster might just be what you need. Just remember to keep an eye on those straps!
