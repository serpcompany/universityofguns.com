<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/azula-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=azula-holsters&utm_term=springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-1"><img alt="springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster has truly lived up to its reputation when it comes to my Springfield XD-M 5. 25". Constructed with a strong proprietary mix of polymers, the durability and rigidity are top-notch. The IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut helps me efficiently clear the muzzle out of the holster, while precision molding ensures a perfect fit for my firearm.

One feature I greatly appreciate is the positive locking trigger guard that provides tactile feedback, giving me peace of mind that my firearm is secure. Additionally, the adjustable retention allows me to customize the fit for my gun as needed. Compatible with multiple belt attachments, this holster is clearly a favorite in competitive shooting circles.

However, there are some minor downsides worth mentioning. Some users have mentioned that out-of-the-box retention can be too tight but can be easily adjusted via screws. Adding or removing from your normal belt may also be difficult due to a fixed secondary security lock piece - though this isn't an issue if you're using a two-sided belt instead.

Overall, I highly recommend this product as it has provided fast draw capabilities and secure retention during intense training sessions and competitions alike, making it reliable and durable in construction at the same time!

I have been using the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Glock 29/30 for several months, and I have found it to be a reliable and durable option.

The precision molding ensures a perfect fit for my gun, so it sits snugly in place without any wiggle room.

Another highlight is the positive locking trigger guard, which provides tactile feedback and reassurance that my firearm is secure at all times. This has given me peace of mind while carrying outside the waistband (OWB), as I know it won't accidentally fall out even during strenuous activities.

However, when running or performing other vigorous movements, there have been occasions where the holster shifted on my belt due to its lightweight design. This can be easily remedied by upgrading to a sturdier attachment option sold separately by Blade-Tech, but it's something potential buyers should consider before making their purchase decision based on their intended use cases and lifestyle needs.

Overall, this product has met expectations given its pedigree derived from Blade-Tech’s legendary Classic OWB Holster lineup while offering a more affordable price point option within their range of premium quality products designed specifically for competition shooters who demand nothing less than top performance from their equipment investments!

Azula Holsters are designed to meet the various needs of gun owners. Some important features on these holsters include:

- Custom Fit: These holsters are specifically molded to fit your exact gun model, ensuring a snug and secure fit. This is important because it prevents the gun from accidentally slipping out while in use.

- Concealed Carry Compatibility: Many of Azula's holsters are designed for concealed carry, providing the necessary level of concealment while still allowing easy access to your firearm.

- Retention Devices: These holsters feature a combination of tensioning devices and positive locking mechanisms to ensure the gun stays firmly in place until you're ready to draw it.

### Considerations when Buying Azula Holsters

Before purchasing an Azula Holster, consider the following:

- Personal Needs: Consider where and how you plan to use your holster. If you're primarily using it for concealed carry, a smaller, more compact model might be best. If you need it for open carrying or home defense, you may want a larger, more durable model.

- Gun Compatibility: Ensure that the holster you choose is specifically designed to fit your firearm. Using an ill-fitting holster can lead to the gun not being sufficiently secured.

- Retention: Make sure that the holster you choose offers adequate retention. This generally means choosing a model with positive locking mechanisms.
