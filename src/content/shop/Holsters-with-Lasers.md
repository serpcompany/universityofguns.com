<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holsters-with-lasers?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=holsters-with-lasers&utm_term=sw-mp-shield-9-40-w-factory-crimson-trace-laser-iwb-tactical-kydex-holster-custom-1"><img alt="sw-mp-shield-9-40-w-factory-crimson-trace-laser-iwb-tactical-kydex-holster-custom-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw-mp-shield-9-40-w-factory-crimson-trace-laser-iwb-tactical-kydex-holster-custom-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the C&G Holster for my M&P Shield 9mm with a Crimson Trace laser for several weeks, and I am impressed with its performance. The holster is well-made, comfortable to wear, and offers excellent retention.

One standout feature is the precision molding that ensures a perfect fit for my weapon. The tactile "click" when holstered gives me peace of mind that my gun is securely tucked away. Additionally, the raised sight channel protects my sights without interfering with my draw.

The slim profile of the Kydex allows it to be easily concealed inside the waistband in various clothing options, making it versatile for different occasions. While there are numerous holsters available for this specific firearm, C&G distinguishes itself by offering high-quality products at an affordable price without compromising functionality or comfort.

Overall, I would highly recommend this holster to anyone seeking reliable concealment and ease of use. It performs well in different scenarios and provides an impressive level of comfort and concealment compared to other Kydex holsters on the market.

After using the Sticky Holster for my full-sized automatic, I'm impressed with its comfort and convenience. The ambidextrous design is a game-changer, offering equal accessibility for both right and left-handed users. Its lightweight construction makes it easy to carry, weighing less than 3 oz. , while still providing a snug fit for your firearm.

One of the standout features is the holster's compatibility with various light attachments and pistols like Beretta, Bersa, Browning, Ruger, Jimenez, Walther, and Taurus. Plus, the laser options offer an added touch of functionality for extra accuracy.

The closed-end design keeps lint and dust out while also preventing gun oil from getting on you. With continued use, body heat helps conform the holster to your gun so that its fit will continue to improve over time. Overall, this holster is a reliable option that provides quick deployment when needed.

Using this IWB holster with my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Crimson Trace Built-In Laser, I was impressed by its durability and precise fit. The. 08-inch KYDEX material offers just the right amount of rigidity to maintain structure, while remaining lightweight enough not to add bulk to my daily carry.

One standout feature for me was the adjustable retention pressure and carry angle, which allowed for a high level of comfort and optimal concealment during extended wear. However, some other reviewers mentioned concerns about single belt clip security and issues attaching it to their belts; your experience may vary in these regards. For added peace of mind, two belt clips could be a welcome improvement in future iterations.

Although it received a 4. 2 overall rating from 359 reviews, there were some mixed opinions on certain aspects of the product's performance â€“ particularly concerning adjustability options like cant angle or ride height variations beyond what is already available â€“ so make sure you assess if this holster will meet your specific requirements before purchasing! On balance though: If youâ€™re looking for a durable and comfortable everyday carry option specifically designed for S&W M&P Shield models equipped with Crimson Trace lasers â€“ then look no further than this quality American-made product from We The People Holsters!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holsters-with-lasers?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=holsters-with-lasers&utm_term=bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-with-laser-1"><img alt="bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-with-laser-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-with-laser-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Bulldog Extreme Belt Holster for a month now, and it has accompanied me on my weekly hiking trips and various outdoor activities. First off, the durable water-resistant nylon shell and top-grade fused padding are fantastic features that provide optimum protection for your firearm. The ambidextrous belt loop and metal clip make switching sides a breeze, depending on your preferences or situation. The soft scratch-resistant inner lining has also kept my handgun secure while carrying it around.

However, I did encounter some cons too. Fitting standard 2"-5" barrel autos with laser or tac light can be challenging because these accessories take up extra space in the holster itself, which may cause discomfort or interfere with your draw if not adjusted properly by the user himself/herself beforehand. Secondly, certain guns do not fit snugly into this model due to their unique shape/design - so a custom made specific fitment might be required instead. Lastly, clipping onto thinner belts may result in slippage when carrying heavy loads like magazines etc. , hence wider belts would serve better here!

Overall, the Bulldog Extreme Belt Holster provides solid basic functionality along with some nice additional features such as ambidextrous belt loop & metal clip plus spine protection layer! However potential buyers should keep certain points mentioned above in mind before making their final purchase decision based on individual needs & circumstances!

I've been using the C&G Holsters for my M&P Shield 9mm and have had a fantastic experience. The fit is impeccable, securely holding my weapon without any wiggle or looseness. The retention is top-notch, with an audible "click" to confirm secure holstering.

One standout feature is the high sight channel accommodating red dot or suppressor height sights, allowing me to use various accessories. The precise and comfortable fit is thanks to proprietary molds and CNC milled construction.

This holster's design ensures it doesn't dig into my skin when sitting down, which I've experienced with other brands before. For concealment, it excels at hiding the weapon under clothing, perfect for everyday carry. The belt clip keeps everything in place without needing adjustment throughout the day.

I highly recommend this product from C&G Holsters for those seeking a reliable and well-built option to carry their firearm concealed.

### [IWB Kydex Holster for Glock 43 with TLR-6](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holsters-with-lasers?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=holsters-with-lasers&utm_term=iwb-kydex-holster-for-glock-43-with-tlr-6)

As a daily user of the Glock 43 TLR-6 IWB Holster designed for the Glock 43, I'm pleased to share my thoughts on this product. The first thing that caught my attention was its slim profile which ensures a comfortable carry under different types of clothing. Its Kydex construction provides durability and long-lasting performance.

One standout feature of this holster is its adjustable retention, allowing you to set the tension according to your comfort level. Another great aspect is the adjustable ride and cant, which gives you maximum flexibility in carry options - perfect for those with active lifestyles. Additionally, the adjustable clip offers up to eight positions for that perfect fit.

The protective sweat guard minimizes contact between your body and gun, promoting hygiene and avoiding skin irritation caused by prolonged exposure to sweat. The secure belt clip ensures smooth draws every time too! Overall, this holster has proven itself as a high-quality product specifically made for Glock 43 pistols with Streamlight TLR-6 Light/Laser attachments.

However, some users have reported issues with retention screw tightness and clips being less than ideal due to thickness or design limitations like print through clothes when carrying AIWB (Appendix Inside Waistband). These are minor flaws that can be addressed by choosing alternative clips or adjusting retention screw tension carefully while keeping safety measures in mind during use! In summary - despite some areas for improvement - this handy accessory meets expectations set by both novice shooters & experienced firearm enthusiasts alike â€“ all thanks to quality craftsmanship put into its manufacturing process right here on US soil itself!

On the downside, there could be more color options available beyond black and white for those who prefer a bit more personalization in their gear.

## Buyer's Guide

### Features of Holsters with Lasers

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holsters-with-lasers?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=holsters-with-lasers&utm_term=holsters-with-lasers-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Holsters+with+Lasers-2/public" alt="Holsters with Lasers-2"></a></div>

A holster with a laser is an essential piece of equipment for gun owners who want quick access and aim assistance. These holsters typically come equipped with a small red or green laser that can be attached to the firearm, providing an in-built dot sight for better accuracy during low light conditions or stressful situations. Here are some key features to consider when choosing a holster with a laser:

### Laser Quality

The quality of the laser is crucial in ensuring accurate aiming. High-quality lasers produce a bright and clear dot that's easy to see even in daylight conditions, while lower-quality lasers may be difficult to see during daytime or produce shaky dots under stress. Choose a holster with a reliable, well-constructed laser for optimal performance.

### Type of Retention System

Retention systems secure the weapon in the holster, ensuring it stays put until you're ready to draw. Common types of retention systems include thumb locks, straps, and tension screws. Each system has its advantages and disadvantages; consider your preferences and intended use before choosing a holster with a specific retention system.

### Material and Durability

Holsters with lasers are available in various materials, such as leather, Kydex, and nylon. Each material offers different levels of comfort, durability, and concealment. Leather is comfortable but can wear over time, while Kydex is more durable but less comfortable. Nylon is budget-friendly but may not offer as much retention or adjustability as other materials. Choose a material that meets your needs and complies with your local laws regarding concealed carry requirements.

### Adjustability

Customizable fit and adjustable cant are essential features for optimal draw and overall comfort. A well-designed holster should allow you to adjust the angle at which the weapon sits in the holster (cant) and the retention tension. This enables you to achieve the perfect balance between accessibility and security when carrying your firearm.
