<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tipx-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=tipx-holsters&utm_term=klipt-iwb-sccy-cpx1-cpx2-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1"><img alt="klipt-iwb-sccy-cpx1-cpx2-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klipt-iwb-sccy-cpx1-cpx2-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my SCCY CPX1/CPX2 for quite a while now, and I must say it has become my go-to holster for everyday carry. The slim design and concealability of this holster is exceptional, as it easily fits on my belt without adding any bulkiness, which I find very convenient.

One of the things that stand out about this holster is its high sweat guard. It ensures that my firearm stays away from my body, preventing any discomfort from moisture or slide serrations. The easy on/easy off belt clip is also a great feature as it securely attaches the holster to my belt effortlessly. Moreover, built-in retention provides positive lock trigger guard feedback so that I know my firearm is safely tucked in place.

Another notable aspect of the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster is its smooth edges and full-length sweat guard, which offer enhanced comfort for all day wear. This has made carrying much more comfortable than with other holsters I've used previously.

Overall, this product offers great value as it is crafted with high-strength heat resistant polymer material produced in the USA. The superior fit and simplicity when attaching to your belt with its 1. 5" belt clip makes it an excellent option for everyday IWB carry without any added bulk or hassle!

I recently bought the Glock 19 IWB holster from We The People Holsters and have been using it for a month now. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. This holster is made of durable Kydex, which provides a thin profile while still keeping my Glock 19 secure. This makes concealment easy under most clothing types.

One feature that stands out to me is the adjustable retention, which allows me to set the tension according to my personal preference. Another great aspect is the adjustable cant and ride height, giving me flexibility in carry positions based on what I'm wearing or doing. The adjustable clip also offers eight different attachment points for my belt.

The holster has a protective sweat guard that minimizes contact between my gun and body, keeping both safe and clean during extended use. The secure belt clip ensures smooth draws every time without any hiccups or jams while drawing from concealment. Additionally, this holster fits standard pistol red dots, making it compatible with popular optics in today's market!

A notable aspect of this product is that all pieces are hand-molded and assembled in their factory in Las Vegas, NV—a testament to their commitment towards quality control standards! However, some users reported having problems with trigger accessibility when using certain claw configurations; always follow instructions provided by manufacturer for safety during assembly/usage of said claw setup. It’s also important not to over-tighten screws when assembling/adjusting your holster as tightening down too hard could potentially crack parts like claws or arms etc. , so always err on side caution rather than overdoing things just because "it feels right". That’s why manufacturers include user manuals after all! 🙂

In conclusion, We The People Holsters did a great job designing this Glock 19 IWB holster; its combination features & functionality make it stand out amongst other offerings within similar price range categories today - definitely worth considering if looking for a reliable yet affordable concealed carry solution tailored specifically towards owners of the Glock 19 series pistols!

### [Adjustable Glock 43 IWB Kydex Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tipx-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=tipx-holsters&utm_term=adjustable-glock-43-iwb-kydex-holster-for-concealed-carry)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tipx-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=tipx-holsters&utm_term=glock-43-43x-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-texas-flag-kydex-adjustable-secure-1"><img alt="glock-43-43x-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-texas-flag-kydex-adjustable-secure-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glock-43-43x-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-texas-flag-kydex-adjustable-secure-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Glock 43/43X IWB Holster from We The People Holsters and have been using it for several weeks. My overall experience with this holster has been positive, with a few minor caveats.

One of the things that stand out about this holster is the adjustable retention feature, which allows me to set the tension according to my preference. This ensures that my gun stays securely in place while still allowing for a smooth draw when needed. Additionally, the adjustable ride and cant allow me to customize how high or low I want my gun positioned on my waistline as well as switch between different carry positions based on what works best for me in various situations.

The adjustable clip is another useful feature, providing up to eight different positions for customizing where on your belt you prefer carrying your firearm. However, I did find that attaching and detaching it can be a bit tricky at times since it requires some effort to release the clip from your belt. Nevertheless, once secured in place it holds firmly throughout use without any issues.

The protective sweat guard helps minimize contact between your gun and body, reducing any chance of rust or corrosion caused by excess moisture from sweating during hot days or intense physical activities like hiking or running errands around town – something that can happen with other lesser-quality holsters out there! This feature has come in handy during some of our warm summer days here in Texas ensuring my weapon stays free of moisture while concealed under clothing items!

Lastly - red dot compatibility means users don't have any issues pairing these products together if they choose so (which makes sense given how popular red dots sights are becoming nowadays). While this feature isn't essential for everyone depending on their firearm setup preference; its inclusion adds value nonetheless by providing more options than many competing products available today! Overall - despite its few minor shortcomings, the Glock 43/43X IWB Holster from We The People Holsters provides great quality craftsmanship coupled with practical functionality making it a solid choice amongst concealed carry enthusiasts everywhere!
