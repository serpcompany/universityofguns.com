### [Automatic .22 Caliber Prairie Popper Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Do All Outdoors. 22 Prairie Popper Target in my backyard shooting range for a while now, and it is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining and rewarding targets I've come across. The lifelike representation of a prairie dog silhouette adds to its appeal, as does its popping action which never ceases to amaze.

The target is constructed from high-quality steel, making it incredibly durable and long-lasting even with prolonged use. The robust springs built into the base deliver an impressive recoil every time the target is hit, enhancing overall engagement. Despite being rated for. 22 caliber firearms only, I've found that it can handle various ammunition types without any issues; though you might need to touch up the paint job occasionally due to hotter loads leaving more marks on the target plate.

One minor issue I faced was mounting it on softer ground but this can be easily resolved with some creativity (such as setting it up on wooden boards). Additionally, these targets can perform well at greater distances than advertised - just note that they might show minor dents instead of popping back up when struck by higher velocity projectiles (like if you try them out with an airgun or. 177 pellets).

In summary, this product has provided countless hours of enjoyment in my backyard range and is definitely worth its price!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-ar500-full-size-ipsc-steel-target-1116706/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased Caldwell's steel targets for some target practice and competition training, and I must say, I was impressed with their durability. The AR500 hardened steel ensures that the targets can take thousands of rounds without any signs of wear. The bright, easy-to-see target feature is an added bonus as it makes it much easier to track my shots.

The three mounting holes provided on the target make hanging them up a breeze - no fuss or complicated set up required! During my time at the range, I tested these targets with various calibers and distances and found that they held up exceptionally well. Even when shooting from close range, there was no deformation or denting on the target plates.

Caldwell's products offer great value for money and are perfect for both competition training and casual shooting sessions. If you're in the market for high-quality steel targets, give them a try - you won't be disappointed!

### [Durable and Visible Rimfire Shooting Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-impact-steel-coyote-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-impact-steel-coyote-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Champion Impact Steel Coyote Target for a few weeks now, and I must say it's a game-changer when it comes to honing my shooting skills. This little target is made of super durable AR500 comparable steel, so you know it's built to last. Plus, setting it up took no time at all - I was able to spend more time on the range and less time fumbling with target set-up.

One major highlight of this target is its high-visibility orange powder coating. Whether I'm shooting at dawn or dusk, that vibrant color always stands out against any background. And speaking of shooting, this 22LR rimfire-rated steel target can definitely take a beating. I've had it out for several rounds now, and it's still holding up strong.

However, there are some cons to consider as well. Some users have mentioned that the target is quite small, making it difficult to see clearly from long distances (around 500 yards with iron sights). Additionally, some might initially be disappointed by its size compared to the Prairie Dog model offered by the same brand.

In conclusion, while there may be some minor drawbacks to this target, its durability and ease of set-up make it a worthwhile addition to any rimfire range. Just remember to keep those expectations in check when it comes to size!

### [.22 Dialed Spinner Steel Target for Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this fun steel spinner target for a while now, and I can't tell you how much enjoyment it's brought to my shooting sessions. It's definitely not your average paper target. The innovative design allows me to switch up my aiming points, keeping things interesting and challenging. The sturdy construction ensures that the target stays put even when I'm firing away with my. 22.

Being a bit smaller than I'd prefer at 7.5 inches, I wish it was a bit bigger. Nevertheless, it has been a fantastic addition to my shooting sessions. It's made out of 1/4 inch steel, which means it's durable and able to handle the power of a. 22 rim fire and even a higher caliber if that's your preference. As I continue to use it and observe its performance, I'll be sure to update my review accordingly. Overall, this is a unique and engaging target that adds a new level of excitement to shooting practice.

### [RangeMaxx Rimfire Spinner Target - Steel](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-rimfire-spinner-targets-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the RangeMaxx Rimfire Triple Spinner Target to improve my shot placement with my rimfire firearms, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. The heavy-duty powder-coated steel construction ensures it'll last a long time, while the swivel legs make it easy to set up and store when not in use.

The most appealing aspect of this target is its ability to provide both audible and visual feedback upon impact. This has dramatically improved my accuracy during practice sessions. Additionally, the large and small target diameters offer a varied shooting experience, keeping things interesting and challenging.

One minor inconvenience I've encountered is the size of the targets, as they are quite small. However, this has actually forced me to become more precise in my shot placement, which has ultimately improved my overall accuracy.

Overall, the RangeMaxx Rimfire Triple Spinner Target is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to enhance their shooting skills with rimfire firearms. Its durable construction, easy setup, and informative feedback make it an invaluable tool in my practice routine.

### [Metal Ferris Wheel Shooting Target for Outdoor Fun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="atflbox-ferris-wheel-metal-resetting-mobile-shooting-targets-for-backyard-outdoor-suitable-for-airso-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atflbox-ferris-wheel-metal-resetting-mobile-shooting-targets-for-backyard-outdoor-suitable-for-airso-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Targets, and I must say, it's a fun addition to my backyard shooting range. The bright orange color makes it easy to spot from a distance, and the unique spinning mechanism adds a nice challenge.

The best part of this target is its ability to spin around its central axis after being hit, which provides a moving target to practice on. However, I noticed that the axis of the target has changed from a straight to a curved design, which could take some time to get used to.

This target is suitable for use with. 177 airguns or air rifles, but I wouldn't recommend using it with high-power PCP airguns, as it may not handle the impact as well. Before using, it's best to give the targets a good spin by hand to ensure they're properly aligned and functioning correctly.

Overall, the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Targets are a unique and entertaining addition to any backyard shooting range. While there were a few minor drawbacks, the enjoyable challenge it provides and its bright color make it a worthwhile purchase.
