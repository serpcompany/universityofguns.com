<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/center-console-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=center-console-gun-safes&utm_term=tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1"><img alt="tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Tuffy Security Console Safe has been an excellent addition to my vehicle center console, providing both security and convenience. The strong construction consists of 1/8-inch welded steel components and a Pry-Guard locking system, ensuring that thieves stay at bay. The exclusive 10 tumbler double bitted lock adds an additional layer of protection for my belongings.

The console safe is cleverly hidden inside the OEM console, making it nearly impossible to detect by passersby. The installation process was smooth sailing; following the provided instructions and taking my time didn't present any significant challenges. The weather resistant lid design incorporates an exclusive hinging system with a built-in lid stop, which comes in handy when accessing items inside the safe without fear of the lid slamming down on my hands.

One feature that I appreciate is how seamlessly the safe integrates with my vehicle's center console while still maintaining its original functionality – it even accommodates for OEM 12-volt ports! Now I can store valuables such as cash or personal documents securely while on the go, without worrying about them being stolen or damaged by environmental conditions like rain or snow.

As for any areas of improvement, I would have appreciated more precise guidance during installation regarding which specific parts needed adjustment for a perfect fit in certain vehicles (mine required some slight modifications). Additionally, though discreetness is vital for this product's success as a security measure - perhaps offering different color options could make it more visually appealing to varying tastes and preferences from consumers? Despite these minor points, overall this Tuffy Security Console Safe has exceeded expectations in providing top-notch protection alongside ease of use!

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Removing the rubber mat at the bottom of the console can be challenging, but following the advice from other reviewers proved helpful.
