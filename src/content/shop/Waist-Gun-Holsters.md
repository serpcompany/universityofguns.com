<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-gun-holsters&utm_term=vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker for my compact pistol and have been using it consistently. This holster is designed to be carried in the front pocket of your pants, providing an alternative for those who don't prefer carrying their firearm around their waistline.

One feature that stands out with this holster is the ability to draw your weapon in three different ways. When you grab your firearm from your pocket, a hook on the corner helps you quickly retrieve your gun. Additionally, you can use the eyelet hardware provided to attach paracord to securely hold it in a bag or purse. Lastly, there's an optional thumb tab that lets you unholster your gun with a simple thumb press.

The custom Kydex mold fit my Glock 43X perfectly, providing a secure and snug fit without any issues while sitting or bending over. Although I noticed some printing when wearing it, it wasn't easily distinguishable as a handgun by others. The optional curve and thumb tab made ejecting the weapon smooth and effortless while providing resistance needed for smoother drawing motions.

Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase of Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker as it offers great comfort and flexibility for concealed carry enthusiasts seeking alternatives to traditional methods like IWB or OWB carry options.

I recently got the chance to try out the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who loves to carry my Byrna for self-defense, having a comfortable holster that allows me to do so both inside and outside the waistband is a huge plus.

What really stood out to me about this holster is its minimalist design. It's lightweight and slim, making it easy to forget I'm wearing it until I need to access my Byrna. The open-muzzle bottom gives me plenty of room to grab my launcher quickly and securely, which is essential in a self-defense situation.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this holster. Some users have mentioned that it can be difficult to re-holster the launcher, especially after a few uses. Additionally, the magazine release button on some models may stick out too far, causing the magazine to be ejected inadvertently.

Overall, I've been very satisfied with my Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster. Its comfortable design and versatile carry options make it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their Byrna with ease and confidence.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-gun-holsters&utm_term=byrna-kydex-waistband-holster-rh-1"><img alt="byrna-kydex-waistband-holster-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-kydex-waistband-holster-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid user of the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster, I can certainly attest to its sleek design and secure fit. I remember when I first received my Byrna HD Launcher and was on the lookout for the perfect holster to keep it compact and easily accessible. The custom fit for both the HD and SD models truly sets it apart from other holsters on the market.

One aspect that genuinely impressed me was the flexibility of the waistband holster. The ability to adjust it to my personal preference allowed me to comfortably wear it all day without any unnecessary strain or discomfort. Additionally, the holster's secure hold on the launcher has given me peace of mind, knowing that my Byrna is safely by my side wherever I go.

However, it's essential to note that the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster doesn't come with the launcher itself, so you'll need to purchase that separately. This might be a downside for some users who are expecting a complete set in one package.

In conclusion, the Byrna Kydex Waistband Holster is a well-designed and highly functional accessory that can significantly enhance the ease of use and accessibility of the Byrna HD and Byrna SD Launchers.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-gun-holsters&utm_term=rounded-belly-band-holster-small-black-1"><img alt="rounded-belly-band-holster-small-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-belly-band-holster-small-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using Rounded Gear's Belly Band Holster for a few weeks now and it's been a game-changer for me. This holster is made of high-quality neoprene which is moisture-wicking and breathable, making it perfect for warmer climates or prolonged use. The wide elastic pockets provide support not only for your handgun but also for weapon-mounted lights and lasers.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the slide protection tab that keeps your firearm away from your skin, preventing any discomfort or rubbing. It's also machine washable, which is a huge plus in terms of cleaning. The size chart allows you to choose the best fit for your waist size, ensuring comfort throughout the day.

However, there have been some issues with retention, as the holster area doesn't narrow at the bottom and lacks a strap to secure your firearm further. I suggest looking into a holster with a safety strap for added security. Additionally, I've noticed some tearing and stretching in the supposedly breathable area, which may affect its longevity.

Overall, the Rounded Gear Belly Band Holster offers great comfort and support for everyday carry, but improvements could be made to address concerns regarding retention and durability. With a more secure design, this would be a top choice for anyone seeking a belly band holster.
