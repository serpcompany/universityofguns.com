I recently had the opportunity to invest in a Liberty Safe's Colonial Series safe, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. As a firearms enthusiast, storage and security are paramount, and this model excels in both areas. The Level 4 Security feature, paired with the SecuRam backlit electronic lock, offers a sense of security I haven't experienced with other safes. Plus, the capacity to hold 25 guns made it perfect for my collection.

The factory-installed door storage panel and single electrical outlet kit are also fantastic additions that make organization and accessibility a breeze.

However, one thing that could be improved is the locking mechanism. The combination lock occasionally feels a bit finicky, but it hasn't caused any significant issues. Additionally, some of the pre-drilled mounting points were hard to access due to their placement behind the gypsum fireboard. These minor inconveniences are far outweighed by the safe's overall performance and reliability.

The combination of features, security, and capacity make it a top choice for gun enthusiasts looking for a high-quality safe.
