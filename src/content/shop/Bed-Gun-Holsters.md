<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-26-27-014pce1z0-1/public"/></a></div>

Experiencing the Die Hard Ankle Rig holster is like having a reliable partner for your daily carry routine. The combination of top-grain saddle leather and a robust PU coating make it incredibly durable and sleek. The holster's smooth leather lining both protects your gun's finish from scratches and provides an effortless draw, making it an excellent choice for those who value a swift response.

The neoprene leg band, padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, ensures maximum comfort all day long. However, some users might find the initial break-in period to be longer due to the stiffness of the leather, but after a few days of use, it will become more flexible and conform to your body shape nicely.

One thing to keep in mind is that this holster is designed primarily for right-handed users as it allows for a natural right-hand draw. Overall, the Die Hard Ankle Rig holster is highly recommended for anyone looking for a high-quality ankle holster that delivers on both performance and longevity. Its features make it well worth its price point, and its comfort and reliability during daily use make it stand out among other options in the market.

### [Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker: Concealed Carry for Small Pocket Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-concealed-carry-for-small-pocket-pistols)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1"><img alt="vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-pocket-locker-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker for my compact pistol and have been using it consistently. This holster is designed to be carried in the front pocket of your pants, providing an alternative for those who don't prefer carrying their firearm around their waistline.

One feature that stands out with this holster is the ability to draw your weapon in three different ways. When you grab your firearm from your pocket, a hook on the corner helps you quickly retrieve your gun. Additionally, you can use the eyelet hardware provided to attach paracord to securely hold it in a bag or purse. Lastly, there's an optional thumb tab that lets you unholster your gun with a simple thumb press.

The custom Kydex mold fit my Glock 43X perfectly, providing a secure and snug fit without any issues while sitting or bending over. Although I noticed some printing when wearing it, it wasn't easily distinguishable as a handgun by others. The optional curve and thumb tab made ejecting the weapon smooth and effortless while providing resistance needed for smoother drawing motions.

Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase of Vedder Holsters Pocket Locker as it offers great comfort and flexibility for concealed carry enthusiasts seeking alternatives to traditional methods like IWB or OWB carry options.

As someone who's been using this Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster for a while now, I can tell you it's a game-changer. It's versatile and comfortable, perfect for activities like walks, jogs, hikes, bike rides, and even everyday use. The 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day carrying comfort, and the breathable open-air weave keeps you cool and dry.

One of the best features is the Hard Laminate Trigger Shield. It protects your trigger from accidental discharges, ensuring safety at all times. The elastic pockets are also a standout feature. They're perfect for keeping spare mags, knives, flashlights, and pepper spray handy. The secure YKK zippered storage pockets are another bonus. They're great for stashing your ID, cash, and keys, and even doubles as a phone holder.

Now, the holster is compatible with all sorts of firearms, making it a perfect choice for both left and right-handed individuals. Additionally, the adjustable size means it can fit waist sizes ranging from 26" to 52", covering most body types.

One issue some users reported was that the holster might be a tight fit for certain models of firearms. In my case, the holster worked perfectly with my go-to weapon, ensuring a secure hold at all times.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster. It's comfortable, versatile, and packed with useful features that make it stand out from the competition.

Named after its exceptional ability to stay low-profile, the Crucial Concealment IWB FN is a fantastic addition to any shooter's collection. The holster stands out in terms of adjustable cant and retention for customized fitment, making it a perfect choice for both left-handers and right-handers. Notably, it's designed with optics compatibility, making it a versatile option for gun enthusiasts across the board.

I personally find the holster incredibly comfortable to wear and highly efficient in its purpose of concealed carry. Its minimalistic design ensures it seamlessly disappears under clothing. However, one minor inconvenience I've encountered is that it occasionally requires a tighter squeeze to achieve a smooth draw.

Overall, the Crucial Concealment IWB FN has been nothing short of a reliable companion in my daily life. Its adjustable features are definitely worth mentioning, as they offer a tailored fit and ease of use. Despite a minor drawback, I feel confident recommending this product to other enthusiasts for its exceptional concealment capability.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-gun-holster-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

### [Warden Chest Holster for Fast Draw Accessibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=warden-chest-holster-for-fast-draw-accessibility)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-black-1"><img alt="elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elite-survival-systems-warden-chest-holster-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me during my outdoor adventures. The adjustable sizes ensure a snug fit for my handgun, even with a light or laser attachment.

One of the highlights of this holster is its ability to provide stability and instant access to my weapon when I need it most. Whether I'm hunting, biking, or hiking, the Warden offers unmatched convenience and peace of mind. Unlike traditional waist or shoulder holsters, this chest holster allows for a full range of motion without fear of obstruction. Its design is similar to that of shoulder holsters, but it places the handgun right in the center of my chest, making it incredibly easy to draw.

The unique holster wrap design of the Warden also impresses me, as it can accommodate a wide variety of handguns with varying light or laser attachments. It's not often that I find a holster that can adapt to my ever-changing firearm preferences.

However, one drawback I've noticed is that the chest positioning might not be everyone's preference. In some cases, it could take some time to get used to the slightly different draw angle when compared to a traditional waist holster.

Overall, the Elite Survival Systems Warden Chest Holster has truly enhanced my outdoor excursions, offering unparalleled access to my firearm and peace of mind. While it may take some adjustment for some users, the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

### [Universal Pistol Holster with Concealed and Protective Features](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=universal-pistol-holster-with-concealed-and-protective-features)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1"><img alt="slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Slicker Pistol Holster, and I've been using it as my go-to weapon concealment tool. This versatile holster offers both chest and leg mounting options, giving me the flexibility to wear it in different ways, depending on my outfit or activity. The material is super comfortable, and I don't even feel like I'm wearing a holster after a while.

The Slicker Pistol Holster is designed to protect your weapon, but it also conceals it incredibly well. The vanishing tan color blends seamlessly with most clothing, making it virtually invisible under a shirt or jacket. The strong materials ensure that your weapon stays securely in place, so you don't have to worry about any unwanted accidents.

One downside of this holster is that it takes some time to adjust to your specific body size. It can be a bit challenging to get the perfect fit at first, but once you've got it adjusted, it's comfortable and secure. Overall, I've been very happy with the Slicker Pistol Holster and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and inconspicuous weapon concealment solution.

### [Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes Handgun Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/public"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my handgun storage solution, and it's been a game-changer. Before, I had to stack my firearms on the shelves, which not only took up a lot of space but also sometimes scratched their finishes. Now, with these clever holsters, I can store all of my handguns securely and make the most of the space inside my gun safe.

One of the main highlights of these holsters is their ease of use. Simply attach the Velcro side to a carpeted wall, insert your handgun, and boom! You've got a secure and accessible storage solution. No more clutter or scratched finishes, and best of all, no more stacking.

However, I did experience a minor inconvenience while installing these holsters. The screws that came with them were too short for my metal-door safe, so I had to visit Home Depot to purchase longer ones. Additionally, I would have preferred if the Velcro on the back of the holsters came with a plus or "X" pattern to eliminate any wobbling. But overall, these holsters have been a fantastic addition to my gun safe.

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters provide a simple and effective solution for storing handguns in your gun safe. With their easy installation and accessibility, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them. So, if you're looking for a way to clear up some space and secure your handguns, I highly recommend giving these holsters a try.

### [AGC Pistol Holster for Compact and Sub-Compact Autos, Snub-nose Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=agc-pistol-holster-for-compact-and-sub-compact-autos-snub-nose-revolvers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=alaska-guide-creations-holster-foliage-1"><img alt="alaska-guide-creations-holster-foliage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alaska-guide-creations-holster-foliage-1/public"/></a></div>

When I picked up the Alaska Guide Creations Holster Foliage, I was excited to give it a try. I am an avid outdoorsman and have always struggled with finding a comfortable way to carry my sidearm. The Holster was easy to use, I was able to attach it to my belt and various packs, which made it incredibly versatile. The adjustable design allowed me to securely hold most of my compact and sub-compact handguns, as well as some shorter-barreled revolvers.

One of the standout features for me was the interior material. It was soft and non-abrasive, which helped to prevent any scratches or damage to my firearm's finish. The Velcro strap was another highlight, as it was easy to adjust and held my weapon securely. The only downside was that I found the holster was a bit too loose when attached to my bino harness, but a quick modification with some shock cord and grommets sorted that problem out.

Overall, I have been very impressed with the Alaska Guide Creations Holster Foliage. It has revolutionized the way I carry my sidearm in the field, offering a comfortable, secure, and versatile solution. I have recommended it to my fellow hunters, and I believe it is a must-have item for anyone who wants to stay prepared and protected while exploring the great outdoors.

### [Adjustable Vertical Molle Tactical Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=adjustable-vertical-molle-tactical-pistol-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/bed-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=bed-gun-holsters&utm_term=condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1"><img alt="condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Condor Outdoor Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster HC, and I have to say, it's been quite the experience using it. Made of high-quality nylon, this adjustable holster provides secure storage for different pistol models. Its wide, lightly padded flap is protected with a large Hook and Loop closure, along with a unique retention system that ensures the pistol stays solidly in place.

Now, speaking from personal use, the first thing that really stood out to me about this holster was its capacity to accommodate a wide range of pistol models. I loved how it could handle not only my smaller Springfield Hellcat Pro but also my bigger, 1911-sized weapons. However, I must admit there were some minor drawbacks.

For instance, the holster was made to fit a wide array of pistols, but it seemed more suited to larger handguns. Even after adjusting the internal strap to change the depth at which the pistol rides, I found that both my Glock 23 and CZ P-07 pistols sat too deeply into the holster. I believe a full-sized 1911 or P226 would fit better.

Another issue I encountered was the cumbersome design of the retention strap. If you need to rapidly deploy your pistol, you might find it difficult. The way it connects and wraps behind the beavertail is just too complicated for quick and easy release.

Lastly, the one MOLLE strap mounting option limits the ways you can wear this holster; it takes up the entire Velcro chest panel. This can be inconvenient if you'd like to mount any other accessory.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I found the Condor Outdoor Holster HC to be a very high-quality product. Its adjustability and strong material are definite pluses. If you're in the market for a reliable, adjustable tactical pistol holster, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.

Bed gun holsters are specially designed accessories that hold and secure firearms, such as handguns, under a mattress or bed frame. This provides easy access in case of emergencies, while also keeping the weapon out of sight and away from curious hands.

### Why would someone want a bed gun holster?

A bed gun holster offers quick access to a firearm in situations where time is crucial, like during a home invasion. It also keeps the weapon hidden, making it less likely to be discovered or stolen, while still ensuring it's readily available for self-defense.

### How do I select the right bed gun holster?

Consider factors like the type of firearm you own, personal security needs, and ease of installation. Make sure to read customer reviews and choose a reputable brand for reliable quality and safety.

### Are bed gun holsters safe for kids and pets?

While most bed gun holsters are designed to keep the firearm secured when not in use, they are not foolproof. Always practice proper gun safety, including keeping storage ammunition separately and maintaining a lock or other security measure on the firearm itself.

### How do I clean and maintain a bed gun holster?

Cleaning and maintenance will depend on the specific product. In general, avoid exposing the holster to excessive moisture or harsh chemicals. Use a soft cloth or sponge with mild soap and water to occasionally clean the exterior. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for proper care and maintenance.
