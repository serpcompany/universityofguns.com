<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tested the C&G Covert OWB kydex holster, and I must say, it's one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've tried. The adjustable retention screw lets you customize how tightly your gun fits, ensuring a smooth draw when needed while keeping your gun secure. The geometry of this holster works well to keep my firearm in place without causing discomfort or chafing during extended periods of wear.

In terms of design, the sleek appearance and durability provided by the kydex material make it an excellent choice for everyday use. The belt clip is also comfortable enough for all-day wear while keeping my gun close to my body. This holster can fit a wide variety of firearms and light combinations, making it an incredibly versatile option for concealed carry.

Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution that balances functionality with comfort.

### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

### [Ambidextrous IWB Mossberg MC2C Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Desantis Gunhole Slim-TUK IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous, and I must say, it's an interesting piece of equipment. The minimalistic design appealed to me initially, but what really stands out is the adjustable tension and rugged 1.75-inch nylon clip that comes with it.

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the tuck-able 360 C-clip, as it provides me with numerous mounting options, making it versatile in various situations. Another notable thing about this IWB holster is the hardware that can be easily flipped to change from right to left-hand orientation for ambidextrous usage.

However, there are certain downsides too. It lacks a certain level of fit for my Mossberg MC2C, which could be a significant issue. Furthermore, the design isn't perfect; the gap between the barrel and the end of the holster is somewhat frustrating.

Overall, this holster offers some unique benefits but also has its limitations. It could be a good choice for those looking for a minimalistic and versatile IWB holster, but I would recommend trying it out with your gun first before making a purchase decision.

### [Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster for Ruger LCP](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gangster-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-ruger-lcp-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster, specifically designed for the Ruger LCP. To be honest, I was hesitant at first because I've had holsters that didn't fit well or felt uncomfortable. But this one pleasantly surprised me.

First off, it's made incredibly light and tough, making it very comfortable to wear. It also has a secure belt-mount mechanism that ensures my gun stays put. The holster gets its durability from 600-denier nylon, which offers four layers of protection including a brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed-cell foam.

Now, while I've had no issues with the holster being loose or floppy, some reviewers did mention that. However, this might be due to individual differences or the type of gun being carried.

One feature that I found incredibly convenient is the adjustability. The straps are fully adjustable and connect with velcro to the holster. These adjustments allow for a snug fit, making me feel secure when carrying my Ruger LCP.

Despite these positives, I did encounter one problem. The straps can be a bit difficult to adjust, especially when trying to slide one side of the Velcro strap through a tight opening. This could potentially lead to damaging the holster if not done carefully.

All in all, I've been quite satisfied with the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster. It's light, tough, and secure, and its adjustability has ensured a comfortable fit for me. The adjustment issue can be a bit frustrating, but this seems to be a one-off problem and not representative of the holster's overall quality.
