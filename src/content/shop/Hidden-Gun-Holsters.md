### [Alien Gear Photon Holster for CZ P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hidden-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster, and I've been putting it through its paces. This modern, versatile holster is truly ambidextrous and can be configured for both IWB (inside the waistband) and OWB (outside the waistband) use. It's optimized for appendix carry, with an included appendix carry wing for concealment, and it even has an optional sidecar mag carrier.

One of the things I love about the Photon is that it's designed with the modern shooter in mind. It's light bearing capable (compatible with compact lights), and it has an optic cut for any optic except the SRO. Plus, it's made right here in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning. Some users have reported missing or wrong components, which can be quite frustrating when you're ready to use your new holster right away. Additionally, the holster can be quite tight and stiff, making it more difficult to draw the weapon than some other options out there.

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster is a versatile and high-quality option for those looking to carry their P320C or M18. Just be prepared for some potential issues and make sure to double-check the components before you head out.
