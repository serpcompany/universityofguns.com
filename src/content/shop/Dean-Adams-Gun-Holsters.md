### [Right Hand Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for S&W M&P Shield 9/40](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=right-hand-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-for-sw-mp-shield-940)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41"><img alt="desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41/public"/></a></div>

The Desantis Thumb Break Scabbard belt holster has truly surpassed my expectations and proven to be an excellent option for concealed carry. The high-quality, thick leather is not only comfortable, but also securely holds my S&W model M&P Shield 9/40. It might take a little bit of time to break in the leather, but once it's molded perfectly to your body shape, you'll be glad you stuck with it.

What I appreciate most about this holster is its customizable carry options through its three belt slots (1 and 3/4 inches wide). This allows me to adjust the positioning of my firearm on my waistline as I see fit, making it easier to keep hidden under clothing without worrying about printing or shifting. The thumb break and precise molding work together with a tension device for added security while still allowing for a fast draw when needed.

In terms of comfort and concealability, this holster rides high on your waistline at the optimum angle - not too low or too high - which aids in both aspects. And with the firearm being presented at an optimum draw angle as well, accessing it quickly has become second nature to me over time. Overall, this product really does deliver what it promises: reliable yet comfortable concealed carry with easy accessibility when needed most!

### [Hybrid Leather & Kydex Holster for Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=hybrid-leather-kydex-holster-for-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/public"/></a></div>

Ah, my Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat. This is not just another holster; it's a daily companion that's been with me through thick and thin. The blend of Kydex's precise retention and leather's comfort is a match made in heaven. No more break-in time, just smooth and secure draw and re-holster.

One thing I particularly love about this holster is its versatility. Whether I'm carrying it AIWB, IWB, or OWB, it never fails to adapt. The adjustable cant allows me to position it just right for a comfortable draw, and the ambidextrous design lets both lefties and righties carry in their preferred hand positioning.

As a bonus, this holster is handmade to perfection at MFT facilities right here in the USA. Talk about a labor of love!

However, it does have its quirks. I've noticed that the screws tend to loosen up more frequently than I'd like, causing occasional discomfort. Also, be prepared for some visible wear over time, but then again, isn't that part of the journey with any EDC tool?

All in all, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat has been a solid addition to my EDC arsenal. It offers a perfect blend of comfort, versatility, and adjustability that makes it stand out among other holsters.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

### [DeSantis Die Hard P365 Ankle Gun Holster, Right Hand, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-p365-ankle-gun-holster-right-hand-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381"><img alt="desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-black-die-hard-ankle-rig-sandw-bodyguard-381/public"/></a></div>

I recently decided to upgrade my EDC carry with the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Sig P365. From the moment I put it on, I knew I made the right choice. The combination of top grain saddle leather and a PU coating makes it not only incredibly comfortable but also extremely durable. This puppy was built with longevity and performance as primary concerns, and it shows.

The smooth leather lining is a huge plus too. It not only protects my gun's finish but also offers a quick and silky draw. The Die Hard Ankle Rig features a tough leather lined holster with a conventional thumb break that's been attached to a neoprene leg band. The leg band is padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, making it feel like a second skin on my calf.

One thing I've noticed when wearing this ankle rig is how confidently I can carry it. The neoprene leg band and calf strap do an excellent job of keeping it secure and in place. Plus, the fact that it's both handsome and comfortable is just icing on the cake.

Of course, no product is perfect. One minor issue I've encountered is that the overall set up can be slightly wider than expected, leading to a bit of 'printing' when wearing certain types of pants. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such an excellent ankle rig.

All in all, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig is my new go-to for concealed carry. It's comfortable, secure, and built like a tank. If you're in the market for an ankle holster, look no further â€“ this bad boy will get the job done and then some.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro and it's been a game-changer in my daily carry routine. This modern holster is incredibly versatile, designed to fit almost any use. Its ambidextrous design makes it perfect for both left and right-handed shooters, and it easily adapts to outside waistband (OWB) or inside waistband (IWB) use.

One feature that particularly stands out is its optimized appendix carry configuration, complete with an included wing for enhanced concealment. I've also found the optional sidecar mag carrier incredibly useful, adding an extra layer of convenience and readiness to my carry.

However, what truly sets this holster apart is its compatibility with various optics, including the ever-popular Hellcat Pro. The built-in optic cut ensures a perfect fit and smooth draw, regardless of the optic you choose, except for the SRO.

Made right here in the USA, the Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro comes with a lifetime warranty, reflecting the brand's confidence in their product's durability and quality.

While I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and flexibility, I must admit that the initial installation process might be a bit daunting for some. However, once you've got it set up, it's smooth sailing from there.

Overall, I would say that the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro is a well-rounded and highly adaptable holster that has more than earned its spot in my daily carry lineup.

### [BB Pistol Mini Scabbard Holster for Hellcat 3](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=bb-pistol-mini-scabbard-holster-for-hellcat-3)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-rh-black-mini-scabbard-holster-hellcat-4"><img alt="desantis-rh-black-mini-scabbard-holster-hellcat-4" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-black-mini-scabbard-holster-hellcat-4/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Desantis Mini Scabbard Hellcat 3 holster and I must say, it's been a game-changer. As a regular shooter, I've tried multiple holsters, but this one truly stands out.

The first thing that caught my attention was its minimalistic design. It's made of high-quality leather, which provides a comfortable fit without compromising on style. Plus, it's locally made in the USA, which is always a bonus!

One feature that really grabbed my attention was the adjustable tension device. It ensures that my Hellcat stays snugly in place, offering both security and convenience. The holster also has belt slots that can accommodate belts up to 1-1/2 wide, making it versatile and practical for everyday use.

However, there's still room for improvement. The holster doesn't come with a built-in safety strap, so you might need to purchase one separately. Additionally, the leather is a bit stiff initially, but it tends to loosen up after a few uses.

Overall, the Desantis Mini Scabbard Hellcat 3 holster has been a reliable addition to my shooting gear. Its unique design, coupled with its functionality, makes it worth every penny!

### [Denix Antiqued Leather Gun Holster for 1873 Replica](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=denix-antiqued-leather-gun-holster-for-1873-replica)

I recently got my hands on the Denix Full Grain Leather Holster DX708, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for my replica 1873 revolvers. This holster is specifically designed for holster waist sizes between 34" and 44", making it perfect for those with a slightly wider waistline.

The first thing that caught my eye was the antiqued finish and brass accents, which give it a truly authentic look. The leather construction not only feels sturdy but also lends an air of sophistication to my collection. The adjustability of the waist size is a feature I absolutely love, as I can switch up my outfit without worrying about the fit.

However, one minor drawback I encountered was that the holster seemed slightly fragile, which made me a little cautious when handling it. Nonetheless, I've been extremely satisfied with its performance overall.

Made in Spain, this holster truly stands out among its peers due to its high-quality craftsmanship and attention to detail. Its compatibility with most non-firing replicas, coupled with the inclusion of 24 replica bullets in the package, makes it a must-have accessory for any collector or enthusiast.

### [Alien Gear Holsters - IWB Concealed Carry for Springfield Hellcat OSP with Optics](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-iwb-concealed-carry-for-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dean-adams-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dean-adams-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-springfield-hellcat-osp-with-optics-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tested out the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster - Springfield Hellcat OSP with Optics for my everyday carry, and I must say it's been a game-changer. This holster is specifically designed for concealed carry and fits my Hellcat like a glove. The injection-molded shell is harder than traditional Kydex, giving it a robust and durable feel.

One of my favorite features is its flexibility in terms of carrying options. With adjustable grip angle and ride height, I can wear it either for strong-side carry or appendix carry based on my preference. Another bonus is the inclusion of a carry claw and muzzle wedge, which helps distribute the weight evenly and prevent any sagging on my belt.

However, I did experience some issues when trying to fit my P365XL with a Sig Romeo Zero Elite. The holster pushed the slide out of battery when inserted completely, and there wasn't enough clearance for suppressor-height sights. Overall, while the Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster offers many desirable features, it may not be the best fit for everyone, especially those with specific sight or slide requirements.
