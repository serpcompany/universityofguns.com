### [Slim & Discreet Klipt IWB Holster for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=slim-discreet-klipt-iwb-holster-for-springfield-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=springfield-hellcat-iwb-holster-inside-the-waistband-klipt-from-blade-tech-1"><img alt="springfield-hellcat-iwb-holster-inside-the-waistband-klipt-from-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-hellcat-iwb-holster-inside-the-waistband-klipt-from-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

For some time now, I've been utilizing the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Springfield Hellcat on a daily basis as my go-to concealed carry solution. What stands out about this holster is its unpretentious design and its effectiveness in keeping my firearm secure while I'm about and about.

The minimalist, discreet build of the Klipt holster means that it tucks snugly against my body without adding any excess bulk or weight. The high sweat guard is a particularly convenient feature as it keeps me completely comfortable by preventing perspiration or slide serrations from coming in contact with my skin. Its easy on/off belt clip has also proven to be quite handy, allowing me to remove it with ease while being confident that it will hold firmly onto belts up to 1. 5”.

Without a doubt, one of the most impressive elements of this holster is its built-in retention mechanism along with its positive lock trigger guard, which gives me peace of mind by providing tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is safely secured at all times. Despite being made from strong heat resistant material, the Klipt IWB Holster feels surprisingly lightweight – something I appreciate when carrying throughout the day.

In summary, my experience using this product has been very positive so far and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who's searching for an affordable yet reliable concealed carry solution for their Springfield Hellcat gun.

It's versatile and comfortable, perfect for activities like walks, jogs, hikes, bike rides, and even everyday use.

One of the best features is the Hard Laminate Trigger Shield. It protects your trigger from accidental discharges, ensuring safety at all times. The elastic pockets are also a standout feature. They're perfect for keeping spare mags, knives, flashlights, and pepper spray handy. The secure YKK zippered storage pockets are another bonus. They're great for stashing your ID, cash, and keys, and even doubles as a phone holder.

Now, the holster is compatible with all sorts of firearms, making it a perfect choice for both left and right-handed individuals. Additionally, the adjustable size means it can fit waist sizes ranging from 26" to 52", covering most body types.

One issue some users reported was that the holster might be a tight fit for certain models of firearms. In my case, the holster worked perfectly with my go-to weapon, ensuring a secure hold at all times.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster. It's comfortable, versatile, and packed with useful features that make it stand out from the competition.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=galco-speed-master-2-0-holster-1"><img alt="galco-speed-master-2-0-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-speed-master-2-0-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

As a dedicated gun enthusiast, I've tried numerous holsters in my quest to find the perfect fit for my needs. The Galco Speed Master 2.0 Holster has been a game-changer! The open top design for speed and safety is truly impressive. It's clear that Galco has put a lot of thought into this holster, as evidenced by the tension screw adjustment for added security and the adjustable belt slot and paddle attachments that give me the flexibility to switch between different carry methods.

I also appreciate the Speed Master 2.0's unique ability to accommodate belts up to 1 3/4 inches wide, making it compatible with almost any belt. The fit and finish of the premium steerhide are outstanding, and it provides excellent retention for my semiauto pistol.

One issue I had was that the tension unit can be a bit too tight initially, requiring some adjustments to loosen up the holster. Additionally, the paddle attachment can be somewhat uncomfortable for prolonged use in certain positions. However, these minor cons are outweighed by the holster's overall excellence.

In summary, the Galco Speed Master 2.0 Holster is a well-designed and versatile option for those looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their firearms. Its adjustable tension unit and multiple attachment methods make it a must-have for any gun owner seeking a reliable, high-quality holster system.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-shapeshift-modular-holster-system)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/public"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is my go-to accessory for my 1911 5" Government. This modular system is perfect for those who like to switch things up and try different carry positions throughout the day. With just a few quick adjustments, I can easily transform the ShapeShift from an IWB holster for casual outings to an OWB paddle holster for more active pursuits.

However, I did encounter some issues with the bulkiness of the holster, especially when using the OWB setup. It's clear that this product is designed with professionals like security personnel or police officers in mind. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and seems a bit wobbly when engaged.

On the positive side, though, the Alien Gear ShapeShift is made in the USA, which is a strong selling point for those who prefer American-made products. And let's not forget the bonus Holster Mount that comes with the Core Carry Pack – it's incredibly versatile and makes it easy to secure my ShapeShift to a variety of surfaces.

In conclusion, while the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack offers a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying positions, it may not be the most comfortable or practical option for everyone. If you're open to trying out various carrying styles and are okay with a slightly bulky design, this product might be worth considering. But if you prioritize comfort and convenience above all else, it might be best to keep looking.

### [Crucial Concealment Covert Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=crucial-concealment-covert-sig-p365-x-macro-iwb-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently been using the "Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO" in my day-to-day routine and must say it's been quite an experience. The minimalistic design isn't just for show, it really does deliver on its promise of effective concealment without sacrificing comfort.

One of the standout features for me was the trigger bump. It added an extra layer of safety without being intrusive or uncomfortable, which is quite impressive. Plus, the fully adjustable cant and adjustable retention make it perfect for anyone, regardless of their preferences. Another thing that really caught my attention is how compatible it is with optics, making it a versatile choice for those looking to upgrade their gear.

However, there are some things that could be improved. While the holster material, kydex, is durable and reliable, it might not suit everyone's taste due to its hard and rigid nature. Additionally, some people might find the black color too plain and boring, but then again, that's mostly down to personal preferences.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient inside-the-waistband holster that offers solid concealment capabilities, the Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO would be a great choice.

### [Hybrid Leather & Kydex Holster for Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=hybrid-leather-kydex-holster-for-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/public"/></a></div>

Ah, my Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat. This is not just another holster; it's a daily companion that's been with me through thick and thin. The blend of Kydex's precise retention and leather's comfort is a match made in heaven. No more break-in time, just smooth and secure draw and re-holster.

One thing I particularly love about this holster is its versatility. Whether I'm carrying it AIWB, IWB, or OWB, it never fails to adapt. The adjustable cant allows me to position it just right for a comfortable draw, and the ambidextrous design lets both lefties and righties carry in their preferred hand positioning.

As a bonus, this holster is handmade to perfection at MFT facilities right here in the USA. Talk about a labor of love!

However, it does have its quirks. I've noticed that the screws tend to loosen up more frequently than I'd like, causing occasional discomfort. Also, be prepared for some visible wear over time, but then again, isn't that part of the journey with any EDC tool?

All in all, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat has been a solid addition to my EDC arsenal. It offers a perfect blend of comfort, versatility, and adjustability that makes it stand out among other holsters.

### [Air Gun Holster - Photon for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=air-gun-holster-photon-for-glock-17)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-glock-17-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Photon Glock 17 Holster from Alien Gear for my everyday carry (EDC) needs. As a fan of their holsters, I was excited to try this new one out. The photon is truly standout due to its modular design – it can be used as both an outside the waistband (OWB) and inside the waistband (IWB) holster, making it versatile for different occasions.

One of the key features that impresses me is the inclusion of an appendix carry wing for concealment. This not only adds extra concealment but also allows me to comfortably carry my Glock without it digging into my skin. It's also great to see that this holster is compatible with compact lights and has an optic cut for any optics except the SRO, showcasing Alien Gear's commitment to catering to modern shooters.

However, there are a few things I would have liked to see differently. The attachment style, which includes a belt clip and paddle, is quite bulky. This made attaching the holster to my belt a bit cumbersome as the claw tends to catch on my pants when trying to clip quickly. I didn't expect such an inconvenience from a well-known brand like Alien Gear.

Overall, the Photon Glock 17 Holster has been a decent addition to my EDC gear. Its modular design is definitely a highlight, but the bulky attachment style could use some improvement for a smoother experience. For anyone looking for a versatile, albeit slightly flawed, holster, this might be worth considering.

### [Condor Outdoor Tactical Ash Vertical Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=condor-outdoor-tactical-ash-vertical-shoulder-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=condor-outdoor-tactical-ash-vertical-shoulder-holster-1"><img alt="condor-outdoor-tactical-ash-vertical-shoulder-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-tactical-ash-vertical-shoulder-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

The Condor Outdoor Tactical Ash Vertical Shoulder Holster is my little buddy in my daily life. It's my constant companion while exploring the great outdoors. The modular design, left and right usage, and adjustable straps make it quite versatile. However, it's a bit like a stubborn mule - it doesn't fit all sizes perfectly. I had to make some adjustments to get the perfect fit for my build. But once it's snug, it's quite comfortable.

The padded holster with double snap retention strap and the padded shoulder harness provide a secure and comfy hold. I appreciate that it can accommodate most medium to large frame pistols. But then, it's a little bulky and can cause my jacket to bulge, which isn't great for concealment.

The highlight of the product is its adjustable straps. It's a one-size-fits-most kind of holster, which is quite appealing. But you need to be a bit patient to get it to adjust perfectly to your size. The material, nylon, is quite durable and light, making it easy to carry around.

In conclusion, the Condor Outdoor Tactical Ash Vertical Shoulder Holster is a decent choice for those who need a budget-friendly and adjustable holster. However, it might not be the best option if you're looking for something discreet and minimalistic.

### [Alien Gear Photon Holster for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-holster-for-springfield-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

### [Sticky Holsters Optics Ready 5 (OR-5) Modified Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holsters-optics-ready-5-or-5-modified-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/air-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=air-gun-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holsters-optics-ready-5-modified-or-5-mod-1"><img alt="sticky-holsters-optics-ready-5-modified-or-5-mod-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sticky-holsters-optics-ready-5-modified-or-5-mod-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've always been on the lookout for a holster that offers comfort and convenience. That's why I was excited to try out the Sticky Holsters Optics Ready 5 Modified (OR-5 MOD). It's designed for easy deployment and adjustment, meaning I can keep my focus on the target rather than fumbling with my gear.

One thing that really stood out to me about this holster is its ambidextrous design. As a lefty, I often find myself having to adapt to right-handed gear. But the OR-5 MOD is truly a one-size-fits-all solution. Plus, it adheres to my waistband, skin, and undergarments without any loops or clips getting in the way.

Another feature I appreciated was how well it accommodates most optic setups. It's made in the USA and fits various firearms like the CZ Rami, Glock 42, Ruger Max 9, S&W Shield, and SCCY CPX-RD. This versatility means I don't have to worry about buying different holsters for different guns.

The only downside I experienced was the difficulty of reholstering. However, considering its lightweight design and ability to keep my gun secure, I can overlook this small inconvenience. Overall, the Sticky Holsters OR-5 MOD has been a game-changer for me in terms of comfort and convenience while carrying my firearm.

Make sure the air gun holster has a secure retention system, such as a Velcro strap or snap-lock mechanism, to keep the air gun in place. This is especially important when you're engaged in activities like hunting or target shooting, where sudden movements can cause an unholstered gun to fall and get damaged. Be sure to check for a sturdy, well-built design that keeps your air gun secure while still allowing easy access.

### 3. Concealment and Comfort

Choose an air gun holster that offers optimal concealment and comfort, depending on your intended use. If you're planning to use the holster discreetly, a compact, low-profile design is ideal. For extended periods of use, such as while carrying the air gun on long hunts, look for a holster with adjustable padding or a well-padded interior to minimize discomfort and pressure points.

### 4. Ease of Accessibility

Select an air gun holster with a user-friendly design for easy access during crucial moments, such as when you need to quickly draw your air gun to take a shot. Consider features like ambidextrous access and a slim, lightweight design that minimizes bulk and facilitates smooth, efficient movement.

### 5. Versatility

Pick a holster that can accommodate different air gun models, sizes, and configurations. This allows you to have a one-size-fits-all solution for your various air guns or even for lending to friends or family members. A versatile holster offers greater value and flexibility, making it a worthy investment.

### 7. Customization and Personalization

Opt for an air gun holster with customizable or adjustable features, such as adjustable tension straps, modifiable retention points, and interchangeable attachment systems. This allows you to tailor the holster to your specific air gun model and personal preferences, ensuring a snug fit and optimal comfort during use.
