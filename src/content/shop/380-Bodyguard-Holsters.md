I've been using the 380 Bodyguard Holsters from Cw380 Holsters, and I am incredibly impressed with their solid locking retention that provides an audible and tactile "click" when my firearm is holstered. This feature alone gives me confidence in the security of my weapon while carrying it.

The comfort and concealment offered by this holster are top-notch, ensuring that my Smith & Wesson 380 stays snug and hidden throughout the day. The inside-the-waistband design combined with its precise fit has made a significant difference in how comfortable I feel while carrying. This precision is a result of Cw380's proprietary molds and CNC milled production process, which delivers quality that other holsters simply cannot compete with.

One standout feature for me was the adjustable sweat guard variation that allowed me to customize the holster to suit my preferences perfectly. Another positive aspect is how easily I can put on or remove the attachment clip from my waistband, making it even more convenient to use every day.

In comparison to other Kydex holsters I have tried, this one outshines them all in terms of reliability, comfort, and protection for my firearm.

I have been using the Fobus Standard Paddle Holster Makarov PM for my Makarov PM. 380 ACP pistol for several months, and it has proven to be a reliable and durable option. One of its best features is its lightweight design, weighing a mere 2 oz. , which doesn't add extra bulk to my carry setup.

The low profile design provides ample concealment, and the passive retention allows me to draw my pistol smoothly without any issues. The added comfort of the rubberized paddle backing during prolonged use is an added bonus. The reinforced rivet attachment ensures that the holster stays securely in place on my belt or waistband.

However, there are some minor downsides to consider with this holster. It has a tight fit initially, making drawing your pistol more difficult until it's broken in over time. Additionally, some users have reported that the trigger guard isn't fully enclosed by the holster, which may pose safety concerns if you plan on using this at public shooting ranges with stricter regulations.

Overall, if you're searching for an affordable and durable OWB (Outside-the-Waistband) paddle holster specifically designed for Makarov PM. 380 ACP pistols, then Fobus might just be what you need. It offers great value for money and delivers solid performance despite minor drawbacks that can be addressed with usage or modifications if necessary.

## Buyer's Guide

### Comfort and Fit:

The first thing you should consider when buying a 380 Bodyguard holster is how comfortable it is to wear. Look for a holster made of high-quality materials that provide good support and cushioning. Also, ensure the holster fits your body type and size so you can wear it all day without discomfort.

### Concealment:

If you plan to carry your 380 Bodyguard concealed, choose a holster that offers excellent concealment. Consider factors like thickness, material, and design. Thin holsters made of soft materials with snug coverage are usually the most effective for concealed carry.

### Accessibility:

Speed and ease of drawing your weapon are crucial in any self-defense situation. Choose a holster that offers quick access while still maintaining secure retention. Some features to look for include adjustable tension screws or straps, thumb breaks, or trigger guards.

### Retention:

Retention refers to the holster's ability to keep your weapon securely in place. A good retention holster will prevent accidental dropping or unintended discharge while also making it difficult for others to remove your weapon.
