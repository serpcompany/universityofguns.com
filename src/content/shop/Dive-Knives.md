### [Benchmade Flyway Knife for Precision Cutting and Outdoor Adventures](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=benchmade-flyway-knife-for-precision-cutting-and-outdoor-adventures)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=benchmade-15700-flyway-knife-orange-g10-handle-1"><img alt="benchmade-15700-flyway-knife-orange-g10-handle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/benchmade-15700-flyway-knife-orange-g10-handle-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Benchmade compact hunting knife for a few months, and it's exceeded my expectations. The blade length and handle design are perfect for handling small game such as birds or fishes without feeling too bulky. The CPM-154 steel in the blade maintains its sharpness and makes it easy to re-sharpen when needed - a task that usually takes just minutes instead of hours compared to lesser quality knives.

The ergonomic orange G10 handle is comfortable to hold during extended use, offering excellent grip even under sweaty conditions or near water sources. The dual-colored Boltaron sheath provides convenient carrying and secure storage when not in use. This knife excels at upland game bird processing while camping or hiking in areas where hunting small animals is allowed, thanks to its smaller size, quality construction, and precision cutting capabilities. However, it can still handle larger tasks like dressing an elk or skinning a coyote if necessary.

Overall, I am very happy with this product's performance for bird and trout hunters who prize precision cutting over brute force handling of their tools.

### [Modern AISI 304 Steel Dive Knife with Serrated Edge and Sheath](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=modern-aisi-304-steel-dive-knife-with-serrated-edge-and-sheath)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=cressi-skorpion-lime-1"><img alt="cressi-skorpion-lime-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cressi-skorpion-lime-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid diver, I was excited to try out the Cressi Skorpion dive knife for my underwater explorations. From my experience, this product has certainly delivered on its promises and made a positive impact on my diving adventures.

The Cressi Skorpion features a sturdy blade constructed from AISI 304 steel which holds up well against wear and tear. The blade comes in two options – pointed or blunt tip – allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs. Its total length of 9 1/8 inches makes it comfortable to handle, even during deep dives. The knife also comes with a locking sheath for added safety and convenience. The sheath's straps attach easily to your leg, making it a breeze to carry around during your dive. However, like any product, there are some minor areas where improvements could be made: initially attaching the straps can be a little difficult due to their sturdiness, but once adjusted they fit snugly. Additionally, while the knife sharpness is adequate out of the box, you may need to sharpen it slightly for optimal performance as recommended by other users too!

Overall though, considering its affordability and impressive features such as line-cutting ability built right into its edge; this dive knife is well worth considering if you're looking for reliable equipment for your underwater expeditions!

I've had the pleasure of using the ScubaPro Mako Titanium Diving Knife on several scuba diving adventures, and I must say that it is a top-notch tool for any diver. The titanium blade is exceptionally strong and retains its sharpness even after multiple uses, which makes cutting through ropes or any entanglements a breeze. Plus, the rust-resistance ensures durability in any aquatic environment.

One fantastic aspect of this knife is its versatility - it has a serrated edge for sawing, a conventional edge for clean cuts, a line-cutting notch, and even a bottle opener. The ergonomic handle is large enough to provide ample grip area along with an added thumb guard to prevent slipping. The unique locking mechanism on the sheath also allows for easy one-handed release while diving.

This knife comes with various mounting options, including grommets for BCD attachment or rubber straps for arm or leg fitting – providing divers maximum convenience when accessing their knives underwater. Some users have reported discomfort from the sharp pointy end on the handle when returning it to the sheath, but I personally haven't faced this issue during my excursions.

Overall, I highly recommend this high-quality and dependable diving knife as an essential addition to your dive kit – it won't disappoint!

After months of extensive use, I can confidently say that the Scubapro Mako Knife is a versatile and reliable dive knife that has become an indispensable part of my diving gear. The hard-tempered stainless steel blade, which is designed to resist surface oxidation, has been an essential tool during various dives, whether it was for slicing through ropes or fishing lines with its line-cutting notch, pruning branches with its serrated edge, or simply cracking open a cold beverage with its convenient bottle opener.

One of the standout features of this knife is its unique locking mechanism on the sheath - making it incredibly easy to release the knife with one hand. This aspect proved particularly helpful in emergency situations when quick access to the blade was crucial. The large handle provides ample gripping area and includes a thumb guard that effectively prevents slippage while underwater - even when wearing gloves!

Although there have been reports of the strap clip snapping at times, this issue did not affect my personal experience with the product. Overall, based on its high-quality construction and useful features such as the one-hand release mechanism and comfortable handle design, I would highly recommend the Scubapro Mako Knife as an all-in-one tool for divers who demand reliability and performance from their equipment.

I recently purchased the Mako Stainless Steel Knife for my diving adventures, and I'm impressed by its quality and versatility. Made from 304-grade hard-tempered stainless steel, this knife is built to withstand the rigors of underwater exploration while still maintaining an excellent cutting edge.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the range of features the knife offers. The conventional edge makes slicing through materials a breeze, while the line-cutting notch and serrated edge give me options for cutting various materials like ropes and branches. The bottle opener also comes in handy when I need to crack open a cold one after a long day of diving.

The ergonomic design ensures that the knife fits comfortably in my hand even with gloves on, and its solid construction makes me feel confident that it can handle any challenge underwater. However, some users note that they were uncomfortable with the pointed end of the bottle opener pressing into their hands; though I haven't experienced this issue personally, it's something to be aware of. Another reviewer mentioned that their strap clip snapped during adjustment, but this seems to be an isolated incident rather than a widespread problem with the product itself.

Overall, I highly recommend considering the Mako Stainless Steel Knife as part of your dive gear collection due to its versatility, quality construction, and comfortable grip – just be sure to test out its features before placing it into regular use underwater.

This sleek and well-designed blade is constructed from 4mm thick titanium, coated in black EDP, making it lightweight yet durable.

Handling this knife underwater was a breeze as the sharp tactical tool on the butt of the handle proved useful for various tasks. The well-made sheath features 1/8" grommets for secure attachment to gear. However, it's important to note that the back of the handle can be a bit sharp when handling closely with bare hands, so caution should be taken when handling it closely.

In conclusion, if you're in need of a new dive knife that delivers quality and performance without breaking the bank - I highly recommend considering this one! Its impressive features and comfortable design make it stand out among other dive knives on the market today.

Although I didn't have to use the knife during my trip, having it there gave me peace of mind as I explored underwater. One potential drawback is that some users may find the knife slightly dull upon arrival and may need sharpening before use; however, once properly sharpened, it performs exceptionally well for diving purposes such as cutting through rope or netting if entangled. Overall, this high-quality dive knife offers great value and would be an excellent addition to any diver's gear collection.

The contoured grip handles were comfortable to use even while wearing dive gloves, making it easy to handle the knives safely and precisely.

The durable ABS thermoplastic sheaths can withstand wear and tear, providing a reliable storage solution for the knives. One minor issue is that the knives may rattle slightly within their sheaths but this shouldn't affect performance during a dive as long as they are securely fastened using the provided straps. Overall, these scuba diving knives seem like a reliable option at an affordable price point.

## Buyer's Guide

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=dive-knives-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dive+Knives-2/public" alt="Dive Knives-2"></a></div>

### Important Features to Consider in Dive Knives

When choosing a dive knife, there are several key features to consider:

- Blade Material: The most common materials used for dive knives are stainless steel and titanium. Stainless steel is more affordable but tends to rust more easily than titanium. Titanium knives are more expensive but are highly corrosion-resistant.

- Blade Shape: Different blade shapes serve different purposes. For example, a straight-edged blade is ideal for general cutting tasks, while a serrated blade is better for sawing through rope or fishing line.

- Handle Design: A good handle should be ergonomic and easy to grip, even with wet hands. Some handles feature textured rubber or neoprene for added grip.

- Sheath Design: A well-designed sheath should securely hold the knife in place while diving and be easy to remove when needed.

### Considerations for Dive Knives

Before purchasing a dive knife, consider the following:

- Intended Use: Consider what types of tasks you'll primarily be using your dive knife for. This will help you determine the right blade shape and size for your needs.

- Comfort and Safety: Be sure to select a dive knife that feels comfortable in your hand and has a secure locking mechanism to prevent accidental deployment.

- Blade Maintenance: Stainless steel knives will need more frequent maintenance to prevent rust. If using a stainless steel knife, be sure to rinse and dry thoroughly after each use.

### General Advice for Choosing Dive Knives

Here are some helpful tips for selecting the perfect dive knife:

1. Shop around and read reviews from other divers to find the best dive knives on the market.

2. Choose a reputable brand known for producing high-quality dive knives.

3. Consider purchasing additional tools like line cutters or spear tips to enhance your diving experience, but make sure these accessories are compatible with your chosen dive knife.

## FAQ

### What is a Dive Knife?

A Dive Knife is a special kind of knife designed for underwater use while scuba diving or free diving. It often features a serrated edge for cutting through tough materials such as rope, nets, or fishing lines, and a flat blade for other tasks like prying or digging.

### How do I choose the right Dive Knife?

Choosing the right Dive Knife depends on your specific needs and intended application. Key factors to consider include blade design, knife size, type of blade (fixed or folding), material of the blade and handle (usually stainless steel or corrosion-resistant alloys), and attachment options for securing it to your diving gear.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=dive-knives-5"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dive+Knives-5/public" alt="Dive Knives-5"></a></div>

### Do I need more than one Dive Knife?

Not necessarily. Most divers find that one versatile dive knife is sufficient for their needs. However, some advanced divers might carry a second specialized knife for specific tasks or environments, such as a smaller backup knife or a tool for breaking ice in cold water dives.

### How should I maintain my Dive Knife?

Proper maintenance of your Dive Knife involves regularly rinsing it with fresh water after use, applying a protective layer of silicone grease or oil to prevent corrosion, and occasionally inspecting and sharpening the blade as needed.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dive-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dive-knives&utm_term=dive-knives-6"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dive+Knives-6/public" alt="Dive Knives-6"></a></div>

### Are there any laws regarding carrying a Dive Knife?

Laws regarding knife possession vary from country to country and sometimes even within regions. Always familiarize yourself with the specific laws and restrictions regarding knife carry in the areas where you plan to dive.

### How do I attach my Dive Knife to my gear?

Dive Knives are typically attached to the leg or thigh using a specially designed rubber sheath and thigh strap. Some knives might also come with alternative mounting options, such as clips for attaching to your buoyancy control device (BCD) or calf straps.

### What is the difference between a fixed-blade and a folding Dive Knife?

- Fixed Blade Dive Knives feature a solid, non-collapsible blade that extends the entire length of the knife, often making them stronger and easier to deploy in an emergency situation.

- Folding Dive Knives, on the other hand, have a blade that folds into the handle, offering a more compact design and easier storage when not in use. However, some folding dive knives may not be as durable or secure as fixed-blade models.

### How do I sharpen my Dive Knife?

To sharpen your Dive Knife, first ensure that the blade is clean and free of any marine growth or debris. Use a honing rod or knife sharpening stone, preferably one designed for use with stainless steel or corrosion-resistant alloys. Hold the knife at a consistent angle (usually around 20-25 degrees) while slowly sliding the blade along the sharpening surface. Always sharpen both sides of the blade evenly to maintain proper balance and functionality.
