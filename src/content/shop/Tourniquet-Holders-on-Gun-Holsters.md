I recently got a chance to try out this Perfect Fit Nylon Tourniquet Holder Carrier Molle Pouch. To be honest, I was thrilled with its quality and design. The pouch fits my CAT7 tourniquet perfectly, and the elastic sides make it really easy to access. The black snap with pull-the-dot safety is also a nice touch, making sure my tourniquet stays in place until I need it.

The only downside I noticed is that the pouch can be a bit bulky on my duty belt, but that's a small price to pay for the peace of mind it provides. Overall, I would recommend this tourniquet holder to anyone in need of a reliable and durable option. It's made in the USA, which is always a plus for me.

I recently had the chance to use one of Battle Steel's Kley-Zion Tourniquet Holders, and I must say, it's a game-changer. The moment I attached it to my gear, I could feel the difference in convenience and accessibility. The 500D IR Signature Reduced Nylon, combined with the MOLLE/PALS-style connectors, made sure it stayed intact during my training sessions.

As an avid user of the Condor Universal TQ Pouch, I've found it to be an exceptional addition to my gear collection. It's not only made with heavy duty materials but also boasts a sleek design, perfect for the urban environment or tactical scenarios. The pouch's adjustability makes it easy to customise, which is a major plus.

One of the most notable features that stood out for me was its compatibility with different tourniquets. I was impressed by how secure and snug my CAT Gen 7 fit in this pouch. Additionally, its ability to be mounted in either the 12 O'clock or 6 O'Clock position offers flexibility based on user preference or tactical requirements.

However, when using smaller tourniquets like the RAT, I did encounter some loose fit issues. Despite this minor inconvenience, the pouch's overall performance and build quality are top-notch, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of a reliable tourniquet holder.

### [Blackhawk Foundation Series Black TQ W Glove Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters&utm_term=blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=tourniquet-holders-on-gun-holsters&utm_term=blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch-1"><img alt="blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-foundation-series-black-tq-w-glove-pouch-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Blackhawk Foundation Series Tourniquet Pouch all week, I can truly say that this little pouch is a game-changer. The material is both durable and flexible, making it perfect for withstanding the elements while still being comfortable to wear. I love the sleek, low-profile MOLLE design that seamlessly integrates into my tactical gear, without adding any unnecessary bulk.

One of the standout features of this pouch is the elastic side panel construction, which offers a multi-fit capability. This means that whether you're wearing a T-shirt or a heavy jacket, the pouch will always fit comfortably and securely. The wrap-around hook & loop top flap ensures that my personalized TQ won't fall out during intense activities, providing peace of mind.

However, there is one small issue I noticed. The front stuff pocket can accommodate latex gloves, but trying to fit two pairs in there can be a bit of a challenge. Additionally, the lack of a label or first-aid patch can make it hard to identify what's inside the pouch at a glance. Overall, though, I've been happy with its performance and highly recommend the Blackhawk Foundation Series Tourniquet Pouch for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient way to carry their TQ.
