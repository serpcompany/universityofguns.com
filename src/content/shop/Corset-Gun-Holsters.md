### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/corset-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/corset-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

I've been using the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer. Crafted from premium saddle leather, this holster boasts double-stitched seams and hand-molded fit, making it a high-quality piece of equipment. The open-top design enables quick access to your weapon, which is crucial in high-pressure situations. And let me tell you, the detailed molding ensures that your gun stays securely in place.

One of the standout features of this holster is its butt-forward cant. I was initially skeptical about how well it would conceal larger firearms, but I've been pleasantly surprised. With a dark t-shirt and the right positioning at 4 o'clock, it's practically invisible.

However, I have experienced one minor drawback. The holster tends to loosen up a bit after some use, but this can be easily fixed by adding a retention strap.
