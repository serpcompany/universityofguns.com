I recently had the chance to test out the C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB, and it has quickly become one of my favorite holsters. The custom craftsmanship ensures a perfect fit for your specific needs, making it both comfortable and effective in daily use.

One feature I found particularly useful was the Open Bottom design that fits threaded barrels and compensators perfectly. This is something not all holsters can do, so it's a big plus for me. Another great aspect is the Custom Dark Wing, which offers added concealment and helps minimize any printing while carrying my firearm.

In terms of security, the solid locking retention provides a secure hold on my gun with a tactile click when holstered to let you know it's locked in place. This gives me great peace of mind while carrying. Additionally, comfort is a top priority with this holster due to its patent-pending hinge system that conforms to body movements during activities like bending or squatting.

The. 093" thickness combined with precision CNC manufacturing (to within. 003 inches! ) makes for excellent durability with minimal added weight for comfortable all-day carry. Plus, all hardware has an added Salt bath Nitriding treatment for increased strength and rust/corrosion prevention - so you know it can handle whatever comes its way!

I did experience some difficulties installing the extra mag carrier at first but their customer support was quick to respond over email with clear instructions that helped resolve the issue promptly - not enough for me to deduct from my rating or recommendation at all! Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality custom-crafted Kydex IWB holster that delivers on comfort, concealment and security – look no further than C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB!

As a gun owner, I've used numerous holsters for concealed carry. Among them, the C&G Holsters stand out in terms of quality and versatility. These holsters are made with heavy-duty materials, providing durability and long-lasting wear.

A unique feature of the C&G Holsters is their adjustable retention, which allows for customization according to personal preference and experience level. This makes it perfect for users who prefer a specific draw style. Additionally, the holster is comfortable even after wearing it all day long - you might forget it's there!

However, some users have reported issues with sizing and fitment for certain gun models. During my testing with Glock models, I did not encounter any such problems but it's something to keep in mind. It's also worth mentioning that these holsters come equipped with a secure clip attachment system that keeps your weapon snugly in place while carrying. Overall, this product provides comfort and reliability in its design - definitely worth considering if you're on the market for a high-quality concealed carry solution!

The C&G Covert holster is an impressive option for anyone carrying a 1911 pistol. I really appreciate the Kydex design, which ensures that my gun fits snugly and stays secure while carried. The retention is just right, allowing easy drawing and re-holstering without any issues.

One standout feature of this holster is its open bottom design, which accommodates different threaded barrels and compensators. This makes it highly versatile, perfect for those who enjoy experimenting with different pistol setups like me.

Comfort and concealability are important factors when choosing a holster, and the C&G Covert does not disappoint. It sits comfortably against my body without creating any noticeable bulges, even when wearing lighter clothing. The adjustable cant and ride height allow me to fine-tune its position on my belt for optimal concealment and accessibility.

Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of craftsmanship in this holster combined with its practical features tailored specifically to 1911 pistols. If you're looking for a reliable and comfortable outside-the-waistband holster, C&G's Covert is definitely worth considering. \n\n

### [Slimline Holster for S&W Victory .22 5.5" - Triple K Carrylite](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=slimline-holster-for-sw-victory-22-55-triple-k-carrylite)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=triple-k-carrylite-holster-sw-victory-22-5-6"><img alt="triple-k-carrylite-holster-sw-victory-22-5-6" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/triple-k-carrylite-holster-sw-victory-22-5-6/public"/></a></div>

I've been using Triple K Holster for my revolver and have found its quality to be quite impressive. Crafted from high-grade leather, the sturdy construction holds my pistol securely, allowing for a smooth draw when needed. One major plus is its versatility, fitting various firearms with different barrel lengths – perfect for those with multiple revolvers or who frequently switch guns. The thumb strap adds extra security against accidental discharge or dropping.

While the holster has several strengths, there are few areas where improvements can be made. Some users mention that the thumb strap may not fit certain firearms correctly, hindering proper usage. Additionally, drawing the pistol requires more force than some might prefer because of how snugly it fits within the leather casing. Finally, although durable and well-crafted, some may find its price point higher than similar products on the market.

Overall though, many believe Triple K Holster to be a worthwhile investment due to its durability and craftsmanship despite these minor issues. For me personally, it consistently delivers reliable performance in securing my revolver whenever I need it most!

### [Xecutive Holster by N8 Tactical: Versatile, Concealable and Comfortable Appendix Inside the Waistband Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=xecutive-holster-by-n8-tactical-versatile-concealable-and-comfortable-appendix-inside-the-waistband-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=xecutive-holster-by-n8-tactical-1"><img alt="xecutive-holster-by-n8-tactical-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xecutive-holster-by-n8-tactical-1/public"/></a></div>

After a few weeks of using the Xecutive Holster by N8 Tactical, I can confidently say it's a high-quality product that excels in versatility, concealability, and comfortability. The all-plastic holster, made from durable Kydex plastic, holds up well against everyday wear and tear while carrying a firearm.

One standout feature is the ability to customize its carry method with multiple clip and wing options. Adjusting retention is also simple; just tighten or loosen screws on the holster body itself for a secure fit that caters to personal preferences.

The minimalist design ensures a small footprint for reduced printing when carrying concealed. The optional soft yet firm foam wedge provides additional comfort while keeping your firearm tucked into your body for maximum concealment. The smooth "skin-side" design prevents unnecessary bulk or protrusions that could cause discomfort during extended periods of wear. Plus, its small size makes it easy to carry without feeling weighed down.

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my experience using the Xecutive Holster by N8 Tactical for daily carry needs at an affordable price point (starting at $40). While some users have reported issues with delivery times due to high demand or custom options selected, this holster is definitely worth considering for its efficient and practical design tailored towards everyday carry needs.

### [Secure IWB Holster for Glock 19 with Streamlight TLR-7/7A](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=secure-iwb-holster-for-glock-19-with-streamlight-tlr-77a)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=glock-19-19x-w-streamlight-tlr-7-7a-light-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-betsy-r-1"><img alt="glock-19-19x-w-streamlight-tlr-7-7a-light-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-betsy-r-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glock-19-19x-w-streamlight-tlr-7-7a-light-iwb-right-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-betsy-r-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the Glock 19 TLR-7/7A Holster from Victory Holsters for a few weeks now, I have to say that it is a high-quality holster that has truly enhanced my daily firearm carrying experience. It offers a slim profile made from durable Kydex, which allows for easy concealment under all types of clothing and makes it an excellent choice for everyday carry.

One major standout feature is its adjustable retention, which lets you customize the tension to your personal preference. In addition, the adjustable ride and cant options provide maximum flexibility when it comes to carry options. For instance, I can quickly change how the holster rides on my belt depending on what I'm wearing or what activity I'll be doing, making sure my gun stays securely in place.

The secure belt clip ensures clean draws every time and keeps my firearm snug while on the go. The protective sweat guard is also a useful addition that helps minimize contact between my gun and body, making it extremely comfortable even during all-day wear in hot weather conditions. Its red dot compatibility adds versatility as well - fitting standard pistol red dots without any issues.

While most features are great, some minor improvements could still be made such as adding more retention points or increasing retention at certain areas of Kydex construction for better security when shaken upside down gently or with an upwards bump on the grip. However, these issues can be addressed with further development by Victory Holsters design team which shows their willingness to improve on an already great product! Overall though, this is an excellent holster that lives up to its reputation!

### [Ambidextrous Extreme Pistol Holster for Compact Autos](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=ambidextrous-extreme-pistol-holster-for-compact-autos)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=bulldog-cases-fusion-belt-holster-fits-glock-26-27-29-30-p22-usp-pt111-ambidextrous-black-fsn-4"><img alt="bulldog-cases-fusion-belt-holster-fits-glock-26-27-29-30-p22-usp-pt111-ambidextrous-black-fsn-4" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-cases-fusion-belt-holster-fits-glock-26-27-29-30-p22-usp-pt111-ambidextrous-black-fsn-4/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Bulldog Extreme Belt Holster for a week-long backcountry mountain hunt for elk. The holster is constructed with high-quality materials and stitching, providing durability and long-lasting use. The strong belt clip ensures secure placement on your belt, which is definitely a plus.

However, during my usage, I encountered some issues that could be improved upon. Despite being well-made and comfortable to wear, the slim velcro hammer strap was not sufficient in keeping my Wilson Combat 9mm Compact 1911 secured in the holster – causing my gun to fall out of the holster more than once during the trip. An enhancement in this area would benefit this excellent holster for concealed or open carry situations. Additionally, as a left-handed individual, I found it challenging to properly fit and use the holster due to its design catering specifically towards right-handed individuals.

In conclusion, while this product has several positive features like its quality construction and strong belt clip, it did not meet all of my specific needs as a left-handed shooter with concerns about securing my firearm effectively. It might be suitable for someone looking for an open carry solution but may require adjustments or modifications depending on individual preferences and circumstances. \xa0

### [Bulldog Extreme Pistol Belt Loop Holster with Clip for 1911 Style Semi Autos](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=bulldog-extreme-pistol-belt-loop-holster-with-clip-for-1911-style-semi-autos)

I recently got my hands on the Bulldog Extreme Pistol Belt Loop Holster with Clip and have been using it for a while now. The holster is designed for those who need something lightweight and adjustable for walking or hunting. It features a durable nylon water-resistant outer shell and top-grade fused padding to provide protection for both your pistol and yourself.

One of the standout features of this holster is its amidextrous belt loop and metal clip, which provides great security in keeping your gun in place. The soft, scratch-resistant inner lining also helps preserve your gun's finish, adding an extra layer of protection. One con to consider is that it might be too large for inside-the-waistband carry. Additionally, due to its weight when carrying a loaded magazine, it may lean forward slightly.

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable holster specifically designed for your firearm model, this might not be your best option. However, if you need something lightweight and adjustable for walking or hunting purposes while protecting your weapon from environmental elements – this product may work well for you. Keep in mind its features when making your purchase decision as 206 reviews give it a solid 4 out of 5 rating!

### [Model 7378 7TS ALS Paddle/Belt Loop Handgun Holster for 1911](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/victory-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=victory-holsters&utm_term=model-7378-7ts-als-paddlebelt-loop-handgun-holster-for-1911)

The Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster has become my go-to choice for various situations, from open carry to concealed carry. The ALS (Automatic Locking System) feature is a standout element, securing my weapon once it's holstered and allowing for a quick, straight up draw when the release is deactivated.

I appreciate the open-top design which, even without the SLS, makes for quick retrieval of my weapon. The proprietary nylon blend used in construction - SafariSeven - is completely non-abrasive to my firearm's finish and has high heat and low cold tolerances that ensure long-lasting durability.

The versatility of this holster comes from its cross draw capability and adjustable injection molded belt loop, giving me options in terms of cant and carrying style. I have had an outstanding experience with this product so far; its robust build quality definitely stands out as one of its key selling points.
