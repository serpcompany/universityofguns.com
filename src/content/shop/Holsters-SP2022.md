The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Sig Sauer P220/P226 was an excellent addition to my daily carry routine. The adjustable retention feature was a standout, as it allowed me to dial in the perfect level of security for my firearm while still providing easy access when needed. This added peace of mind was especially noticeable during long days on the job, where it prevented any unwanted movement or shifting.

I also appreciated the holster's compatibility with various attachments due to its versatile mounting pattern. I frequently switched between different belts and accessories, and this holster made that transition seamless. Its precision molded design ensured a perfect fit for my Sig P220/P226 every time, which is crucial when carrying concealed all day.

However, there were a few areas where I think improvements could be made. For instance, while the optic ready speed cut did help clear out my muzzle quickly during training sessions, it wasn't quite as effective as I had hoped – especially when using certain types of optics on my gun. Additionally, although adjusting retention worked well most times; there were moments where minor tweaking felt necessary but proved too difficult due to the limited options available at hand (either tightening or loosening). Despite these minor shortcomings though overall experience with this holster was quite positive given its quality construction coupled up by reasonable price point offered by Blade Tech.

One of the standout features is the high sweat guard, which has been incredibly useful in preventing discomfort from moisture or slide serrations.
