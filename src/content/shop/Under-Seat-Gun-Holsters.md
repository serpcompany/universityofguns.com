### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

### [TheCHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1/public"/></a></div>

When it comes to my everyday carry, being able to secure my firearm discreetly and comfortably is a top priority. That's why I decided to give the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster a try. I'm not one for flashy options, so the Gun Sox in black really caught my eye.

From the moment I put it on, I was impressed by the smooth draw and the fact that there was no shifting or sliding down my leg. It was so comfortable that I forgot I was carrying my firearm, which is a huge plus for me.

One feature that stood out was the proprietary Pant Protector. This little addition prevented any damage to my pant leg fabric from the gun sight, which was a nice surprise.

However, I did have one issue with the product - it wasn't true to size, so I had to return it. Despite this minor inconvenience, I believe that the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster is definitely worth considering for anyone looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their small to mid-sized firearms.

### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

### [Safariland Model 7378 ALS Hellcat Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter who's always on the lookout for the perfect holster, I can't tell you how much I've come to rely on the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster. It's not just another piece of gear; it's a game-changer in terms of convenience and reliability.

This holster surprised me with its robust combination of features. The automatic locking system (ALS) instantly secures your weapon when you holster it, giving you peace of mind knowing your firearm is safely tucked away. But when it comes time to draw, the ALS release is a breeze to deactivate, allowing for a swift and natural draw - an excellent balance between safety and speed.

I also appreciate its open-top design without the SLS (Self-Locking System). It's quick and easy to retrieve your weapon without any unnecessary fumbling around. And the SafariSeven construction? It's brilliant. This proprietary nylon blend is not only incredibly durable but also completely non-abrasive to your firearm's finish. Plus, it boasts remarkable heat and cold tolerance, making it structurally sound from 300°F to -50°F.

The adjustable belt loop is another highlight. It's perfect for customizing your draw angle and accommodating different carrying positions. Even better, it's so comfortable to wear that I often forget I'm packing.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The sleek design can make gripping the holster a bit challenging when removing it from your belt. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure the release button is fully engaged, or the ALS might inadvertently secure your weapon while attempting to draw.

Overall, the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster has become an indispensable part of my shooting arsenal. It's reliable, versatile, and incredibly comfortable to wear. Highly recommended!

The best thing about this product is how well it blends with the truck's interior, making it virtually invisible when the seat is folded up. It's like having a secret compartment that no one knows about! Plus, its compatibility with my 1999-2007 Chevrolet Silverado/Sierra Extended Cab model truck means it's a perfect fit for both style and function.

Another highlight is the built-in organizers and gun racks, which have made storing my shotguns and rifles so much easier and more secure. I appreciate how durable the heavy-duty polyethylene plastic construction is, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are protected from any potential harm.

However, there have been a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the installation process can be a bit tricky for some, especially if you're not familiar with working on vehicles. Secondly, while the compatibility with 1999-2007 models is excellent, it may not be suitable for those with later model years or other truck brands.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the DU-HA Underseat Storage to anyone looking for an efficient and discreet way to store their gear. It's truly a game-changer that has made my daily life much more organized and worry-free.

The sturdy construction is definitely a highlight, giving me peace of mind that my belongings are well-protected. However, the installation process did require a bit of DIY effort - I had to fabricate a bracket and weld it to the lockbox for a seamless fit in my car.

All in all, the Tufloc Mini Tufbox has provided me with the added security and convenience that I was looking for. I would recommend it to anyone shopping for a lockbox solution.

It also has dividers that not only help organize my stuff but can also be used as gun racks for my hunting trips. The construction is also quite sturdy, I can tell this thing is going to last a long time.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the height of the box is slightly lower than the bottom of the seat, which means some of my stuff peeks out from the sides. But it's not a dealbreaker by any means. I'm even thinking of customizing it to make it look neater.

Overall, I really like the DU-HA. It's incredibly easy to install and provides a lot of storage for all my truck essentials. If you're on the lookout for a high-quality underseat storage, the DU-HA is definitely worth considering.

In a nutshell, the DU-HA Underseat Brown Storage Case has significantly improved the organization and cleaning capabilities of my truck.
