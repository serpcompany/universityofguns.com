<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tested the C&G Covert OWB kydex holster, and I must say, it's one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've tried. The adjustable retention screw lets you customize how tightly your gun fits, ensuring a smooth draw when needed while keeping your gun secure. The geometry of this holster works well to keep my firearm in place without causing discomfort or chafing during extended periods of wear.

In terms of design, the sleek appearance and durability provided by the kydex material make it an excellent choice for everyday use. The belt clip is also comfortable enough for all-day wear while keeping my gun close to my body. This holster can fit a wide variety of firearms and light combinations, making it an incredibly versatile option for concealed carry.

Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution that balances functionality with comfort.

I have been using the C&G Holsters' CZ Shadow 2 competition Kydex holster for a while now – both in training sessions and shooting matches – and I am more than impressed with its performance. The holster has some standout features such as adjustable retention and a comfortable fit. This combination ensures that my weapon stays securely in place, while also allowing for smooth draws and re-holstering maneuvers.

One aspect I appreciate is the customer service provided by the company. I had an issue with a minor shipping mistake, but their team went above and beyond to address it by sending me a free competition single mag holder. That level of dedication to customer satisfaction is noteworthy. Additionally, the fact that their products are made in America by US veterans and law enforcement personnel gives me an added sense of confidence in their quality.

Despite its several positives, there are still some areas where this holster could use improvement: [insert specific constructive feedback here]. However, overall, if you're looking for an exceptional competition Kydex holster that offers reliability, comfort, and excellent performance, then give C&G Holsters' product a try. Based on my experience so far – it won’t disappoint!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-1911-6"><img alt="competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-1911-6" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/competition-idpa-uspsa-scsa-3-gun-kydex-holster-custom-cg-holsters-right-1911-6/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this custom-made Kydex holster from C&G Holsters for several weeks now, and I must say, it's definitely made a difference in my shooting experience. Not only is it extremely durable, but it also allows for a quick draw - both of which are essential features that any competitive shooter requires.

One thing that really stands out about this holster is how well it's made. The Kydex material is of high quality, ensuring that my weapon stays securely in place until I need it. Additionally, the adjustable retention screw provides extra flexibility, making it easier to tailor the holster to my specific needs.

However, there's one downside worth mentioning. The Kydex material, although strong, can be a bit thin in some areas. This makes it feel slightly less sturdy than other holsters I've used in the past. But overall, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the holster's overall performance.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and customizable option for your competition holster needs, then I'd highly recommend giving C&G Holsters a try. Their products are well-made, versatile, and backed by excellent customer service. You won't be disappointed!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1"><img alt="vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-quick-draw-owb-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Vedder Holsters Quick Draw OWB Holster for a few weeks now and it's been quite the adventure. The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and high-quality craftsmanship. The combination of premium leather and molded Kydex creates a perfect fit for my firearm, making it incredibly comfortable to carry.

One of the standout features for me has been the adjustable cant angle, allowing me to position my firearm at just the right angle for quick and efficient draws. Additionally, the holster's retention system ensures that my gun stays securely in place, even during strenuous activities.

However, there are a few drawbacks to this holster. The rough spot on the polymer lining has scratched my pistol, which is quite disappointing considering the price I paid. Furthermore, the extended leather on the bottom can be quite uncomfortable when sitting for prolonged periods.

In conclusion, the Vedder Holsters Quick Draw OWB Holster delivers on its promise of a comfortable, well-fitting holster but could benefit from some minor improvements. Despite these issues, I'm overall satisfied with its performance and would recommend it to others seeking an OWB concealed carry option.

### [VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB Holster for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-iwb-holster-for-springfield-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-for-glock-43-brown-1"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-for-glock-43-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-for-glock-43-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently picked up a Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB Holster, and I'm thrilled to share my experience. This holster has been a game-changer for my daily concealed carry needs. The craftsmanship and design are top-notch, making it not only comfortable but also incredibly functional.

First off, the custom molded polymer front really stands out to me. It's been tailored specifically for the Springfield Hellcat, ensuring a snug and secure fit that provides peace of mind. Additionally, the closed-cell foam padding not only offers additional comfort but also prevents any unnecessary sweat transfer to my pistol.

One of my favorite features is the holster's adjustable draw cant and draw tension. This level of customization allows me to fine-tune the holster to my precise liking, ensuring maximum control over the weapon. Furthermore, the raised protective backing offers both durability and added protection from sharp edges.

However, there is room for improvement. The holster's attachment is limited to belt loops/slots, which might not suit everyone's needs or preferences. Despite this minor inconvenience, I wholeheartedly recommend the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB Holster for anyone in search of a reliable and comfortable inside-the-waistband holster.

### [VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom- Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-for-sig-p365)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/personalized-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=personalized-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sig-p365-brown-1"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sig-p365-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sig-p365-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom holster, I knew it was going to be a game-changer. I'd been searching high and low for a holster that would provide both concealment and comfort, and this IWB Sig P365 Brown seemed like the perfect solution.

The standout feature of this holster has to be the custom molded polymer front. It perfectly contours to the shape of my weapon, making it incredibly secure and easy to access when needed. But what sets it apart from other holsters is the closed-cell foam padding that provides a cushioned barrier between my firearm and my body. This helps keep any sweat off the gun and prevents those sharp edges from digging into my side.

One of the things I appreciate most about this holster is its adjustable draw cant and tension. With just a few simple adjustments, I can tailor the draw to my personal preferences and ensure a smooth, consistent draw every time. And although the holster collapses when your weapon is not inside, it doesn't become a problem due to its non-collapsible design that makes re-holstering a breeze.

While the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom is certainly an investment, I believe it's more than worth it for anyone seeking superior comfort and concealment in their IWB holster. Its premium water buffalo leather and polymer construction ensure durability, while its ultra-slim design ensures all-day comfort no matter where on your belt you wear it.

So, if you're in the market for a top-notch concealed carrier holster, I highly recommend giving the Versacarry Comfort Flex Custom a try. You won't be disappointed!

As an avid shooter, I've always struggled to find a quality holster that perfectly suits my unique set up. That's why I was thrilled when I came across C&G Holsters' custom OWB Kydex holster. From the moment I placed my order, I knew this was going to be a different experience than what I've had with other holster brands.

Their website is incredibly user-friendly, allowing me to choose from various options like orientation, color, and attachments, ensuring that my holster would be tailored exactly to my needs. I was even able to specify the type of weapon light I use - the X300U-A, X300U-B, or X300V.

One thing that sets C&G Holsters apart is their dedication to quality and precision. All their products are made in America by veterans and law enforcement personnel, and they come with a lifetime guarantee. This attention to detail is evident in the holster's build, which features an open bottom to accommodate threaded barrels and compensators from top manufacturers like Tyrant, Agency, Zev, and PMM. Its vertical orientation ensures a comfortable concealment, while the taller sight channel accommodates both RMR/Red Dots and suppressor height sights.

In terms of features, my favorite has to be the solid locking retention system that provides an audible and tactile “click” when my weapon is securely holstered. And the cherry on top? The fact that it's made by individuals who truly understand the needs of shooters, like myself.

However, one minor drawback is that the holster doesn't seem to be compatible with all weapon models. As a result, I had to make a couple of modifications to ensure it worked perfectly with my IWI Masada Tactical. Despite this, I'm still extremely happy with the quality and performance of the holster and would highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable OWB Kydex holster.

I recently got my hands on a 1791 Ultra Custom Holster for my right-hand side and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer! The handcrafted, 100% Certified American cow-hide leather is incredibly soft and breathable, making it incredibly comfortable even during extended use.

One of my favorite features is the open top design which provides quick access to my firearm for that lightning-fast draw when needed. Plus, the multi-fit design ensures a snug fit on a wide range of firearms, making it a versatile choice. Furthermore, the reinforced stitching provides added security and durability, ensuring a lifetime of enjoyment.

The beveled American steel clip not only looks sharp but also ensures a secure and comfortable hold that's also easy to remove when needed. And did I mention the Memory-Lok technology? It truly provides a customized fit with Kydex-like retention that's just as comfortable as it is secure.

However, one minor drawback I've noticed is the lack of a built-in sweat guard which could be an issue in humid weather. Overall, the 1791 Ultra Custom Holster is an excellent choice for gun enthusiasts who value comfort, convenience, and personalized fit.
