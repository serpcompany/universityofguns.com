### [Urban Carry Heavy Duty Eb Leather Gun Belt - 38 34in Waist Black UC-BLT-BK-38-EngBri](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=urban-carry-heavy-duty-eb-leather-gun-belt-38-34in-waist-black-uc-blt-bk-38-engbri)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=urban-carry-heavy-duty-eb-leather-gun-belt-38-34in-waist-black-uc-blt-bk-38-engbri-1"><img alt="urban-carry-heavy-duty-eb-leather-gun-belt-38-34in-waist-black-uc-blt-bk-38-engbri-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/urban-carry-heavy-duty-eb-leather-gun-belt-38-34in-waist-black-uc-blt-bk-38-engbri-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased an Urban Carry Heavy Duty Eb Leather Gun Belt to support the weight of my holster and handgun without any issues. The belt is proudly made in specialized factories, with 1/4 inch thick English Bridle Leather that's hand made to suit my needs perfectly.

The sizing of the belt was quite informative, as it explained in detail how to measure and determine the correct size for my waist. The size guide recommended adding four inches to your pant size, which was quite accurate for me and made the purchase process much easier.

However, one drawback of the belt is that the finish on the Classic Brown ("Tan") Holster and Belt is only Fair to Good, which was quite disappointing. Their Black Finish was considerably better. Despite this issue, I have been using the belt for quite some time now, and it continues to provide exceptional support and durability.

In conclusion, Urban Carry's Heavy Duty Eb Leather Gun Belt is a high-quality product that is not only comfortable and attractive but also easy to adjust. Its excellent customer support and fast shipping make it an ideal choice for gun enthusiasts looking for a reliable and sturdy solution to carry their holster and handgun.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=5-11-1-5-apex-gunners-belt-dark-horse-brown-1"><img alt="5-11-1-5-apex-gunners-belt-dark-horse-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-1-5-apex-gunners-belt-dark-horse-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the 5.11 Apex Gunner's Belt in Dark Horse Brown, and I'm happy to report that this belt has significantly improved my daily life. The ergonomic curve on this belt provides an already broken in feel, making it incredibly comfortable to wear all day. The B10 web material and TPU coating offer exceptional durability, with a tensile strength of 1,500 lbs. !

One aspect that stands out is the Type 3 cast aluminum anodized buckle with dual retention prongs, which offers excellent security and stability. This belt has truly made a difference in how I carry and support my belongings throughout the day. The versatile style of this belt can easily transition from business attire to casual wear, making it perfect for various environments.

However, there are a few minor cons that I've come across while using this belt. While the ergonomic curve is great for comfort, it can make adjusting the belt slightly more difficult. Additionally, some users might find the buckle a bit too sharp, which could potentially cause wear on clothing.

Overall, I highly recommend the 5.11 Apex Gunner's Belt for anyone looking for a comfortable and functional solution for their daily needs. The durable construction and versatile style make this belt a great addition to anyone's wardrobe.

### [5.11 Tactical Operator Belt - Coyote](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=511-tactical-operator-belt-coyote)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=5-11-tactical-operator-belt-coyote-large-1"><img alt="5-11-tactical-operator-belt-coyote-large-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-tactical-operator-belt-coyote-large-1/public"/></a></div>

Wow, this 5.11 Operator Belt is an absolute game-changer! As a reviewer who's had the pleasure of using it daily for quite some time now, I must say it's been an outstanding companion. The first time I put it on, it felt super comfortable - almost like it was custom-made to fit my waist perfectly. And when I carry my holster and accessories, it gives me the confidence of knowing they're securely fastened in place.

One of the standout features for me has to be its durability. The heavy-duty nylon mesh material and the robust stainless steel buckle make it virtually indestructible. Even after months of rough use, I haven't seen any signs of wear or tear, which is quite impressive. Plus, the reinforcement stitching ensures that the belt stays in pristine condition no matter how much load it carries.

Now, let's talk about the practicality aspect. The 5.11 Operator Belt easily doubles as a tie-down or secondary carry strap, making it incredibly versatile. I find this so useful when I need to secure heavy equipment or gear quickly and efficiently.

On the flip side, there is one minor issue – and that's the sizing. You see, adjusting the belt to fit perfectly can be a bit tricky, especially for those who frequently alternate between inside and outside waistband carry methods. So, make sure you order a size larger than you need to accommodate different belt sizes.

Lastly, I would also recommend getting a couple of belt loops if you're planning on wearing this belt in a way where the loose end doesn't reach the Velcro. This would add an extra touch of convenience and ease of use.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the 5.11 Operator Belt. Its durability, versatility, and comfort make it one of the best tactical belts out there.

### [CrossBreed Black Executive Gun Belt](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=crossbreed-black-executive-gun-belt)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wethepeople-gun-belt?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=wethepeople-gun-belt&utm_term=crossbreed-black-executive-gun-belt-1"><img alt="crossbreed-black-executive-gun-belt-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-black-executive-gun-belt-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Crossbreed Black Executive Gun Belt, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who needs to carry both a dress belt and a gun belt, this product has saved me from having to choose one or the other.

The first thing that caught my eye was the superior craftsmanship. They've used high-quality hides, carefully tanned to their specifications, and hand-leveled to ensure uniform thickness. The belt is then paired with a nylon mesh core liner and joined together with discreet stitching, giving it an overall sleek look.

This belt's width and thickness provide exceptional support while remaining flexible enough for comfortable everyday use. I've found that it doesn't dig into my sides like some other belts I've tried in the past. Plus, it's excellent for concealed carry, giving me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are secure.

However, one downside I noticed is that the belt can feel a bit bulky at times. While it offers great support, it might be too thick for some people's preferences. Additionally, some users reported issues with the buckle breaking after extended use, so keep an eye on that if you decide to invest in this belt.

Overall, I highly recommend the Crossbreed Black Executive Gun Belt for anyone looking for a versatile and durable option for both dress and concealed carry purposes. Its sturdy construction and sleek design make it a worthwhile addition to your wardrobe.
