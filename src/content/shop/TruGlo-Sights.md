I recently got my hands on the TruGlo TSX Pro Series Standard Sight and I've been using it extensively for the past few weeks. This sight is based on the award-winning TRU-SITE XTREME Series design, making it an ultrastrong and lightweight option for any archer. The stainless steel tube helps illuminate the pins, while the ultra-fine click adjustment allows for precise windage and elevation adjustments. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the Tru-Touch soft-feel technical coating, which ensures silence and extra durability during use. Additionally, the glow-in-the-dark shooters ring, luminescent tape at the level, and adjustable rheostat light deliver glare-free, eye-to-pin focus in any condition. The adjustable second- and third-axis level with two vertical bars further enhances accuracy and ensures a consistent shooting experience. 

Another notable feature is the reversible bracket, offering greater vertical adjustability as needed. The aperture has a 2-inch inner diameter with. 019-inch pins, making it suitable for right- or left-handed bows. The black finish adds a sleek touch to the overall design. 

However, there are some cons that I've encountered while using this sight. Firstly, the light isn't as bright as expected, especially in low-light conditions. Additionally, the pins can be quite challenging to align properly at times. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the TruGlo TSX Pro Series Standard Sight. It offers various useful features and is a great option for those looking to improve their accuracy and overall shooting experience. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as the not-so-bright light and finicky pin alignment, I believe that these can be easily overlooked given the sight's many benefits and competitive price point.
