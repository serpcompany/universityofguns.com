I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging.

There are a few minor cons worth mentioning though. The initial installation can take a bit of time due to the fine-tuning of the retention screws. Additionally, while the holster itself is very comfortable, I did experience a slight learning curve when getting used to the different grip angle provided by the Trigger Bump.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Crucial Concealment Ambi Covert IWB FN Reflex holster for those prioritizing concealed carry. Its blend of features, durability, and functionality make it a standout choice.
