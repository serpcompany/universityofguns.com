After months of putting the Winchester TS20-30 Gun Safe to use, I can say it exceeds expectations in security and usability. The 30 minute fire rating and sturdy electronic lock provide peace of mind while ensuring safe protection for valuables.

The gun safe arrived in excellent condition and was simple to assemble, with clear instructions provided by the manufacturer. The spacious interior can accommodate up to 20 long guns and additional storage for smaller items such as ammunition or documents. The single-lever handle adds an extra layer of security while making access easy when needed. Predrilled holes in the bottom make bolting down an option, adding even more stability and protection against unauthorized entry or movement.

The limited space for shelves if using both sides for rifles is a minor inconvenience, but overall, this Winchester gun safe delivers reliable protection at a reasonable price point. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch safe that balances safety with ease-of-use features like electronic locking mechanisms while also providing exceptional value on investment compared to similar products available on market today!

### [5-Gun Secure Metal Storage Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=5-gun-secure-metal-storage-cabinet)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet, and I must say, I'm quite impressed by its design and features. This compact cabinet is perfect for securing my long guns, and it definitely adds a sense of security to my home.

One of the standout features of this cabinet is its three-point locking system. It provides that extra layer of security that I was looking for. Additionally, the high-quality black powder-coated paint gives it a sleek and attractive finish.

Another aspect that I really like about this product is its soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor. This ensures that my firearms stay safe and intact, even during those tumultuous times when you might need to quickly retrieve them.

One downside to this cabinet, however, is its assembly. It comes fully assembled, which is a great feature for convenience, but it's not the sturdiest. There have been a few instances where the seams have come undone, causing some concern about the overall durability of the cabinet.

Despite this minor issue, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet has been a great addition to my home. It provides peace of mind and ensures that my firearms are kept in a secure and organized space.

One of the standout features of this safe is the fast and easy-to-use electronic lock, which comes in handy when accessing my firearms in low light situations. The sturdy construction and ample storage space allow me to store a variety of long guns and handguns with ease. However, I must admit that the provided gun holders are not as effective as I had hoped, making it difficult to secure rifles with scopes or red dots.

Despite its minor flaws, I am extremely satisfied with the Provault 12-Gun Safe by Liberty. Its high-quality craftsmanship, fire protection capabilities, and ease of use make it an excellent choice for gun owners looking to secure their firearms collection.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=browning-rawhide-49-tall-wide-gun-safe-rw49t-1"><img alt="browning-rawhide-49-tall-wide-gun-safe-rw49t-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-rawhide-49-tall-wide-gun-safe-rw49t-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Browning Rawhide 49 Tall Wide Gun Safe for my collection of firearms and it has not disappointed. The first thing that caught my eye is the 11-Gauge steel body which, together with the Pry-Stop End Bolts, offers incredible resistance to break-ins. Not to mention, the safe boasts an impressive 1550° F/80 min. fire rating, keeping my weapons safe and sound in case of any emergencies.

One feature that I absolutely love is the faux leather-trimmed interior. It adds a nice touch of rugged class to the safe while providing ample room for my gun collection. The only issue I've come across is the smell. When I first opened the safe, it reminded me of a boot aisle at a store. However, after a few weeks, the smell has faded to a more bearable level.

Overall, if you're looking for a spacious, highly secure, and stylish gun safe, the Browning Rawhide 49 Tall Wide Gun Safe RW49T is definitely worth considering. It offers superior resistance against break-ins, a hefty fire rating for added protection, and a beautifully designed interior that accommodates numerous firearms.

### [Browning Sporter Gun Safe: Secure Storage for 23 Long Guns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=browning-sporter-gun-safe-secure-storage-for-23-long-guns)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1"><img alt="browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a gun owner, I've been using Browning's SP23 Sporter Gun Safe in my home for the past year. It's been a game-changer, providing certified security while also fitting perfectly in tight spaces. The SP23's smaller size makes it perfect for keeping home defense rifles or shotguns accessible, but secure, in my bedroom.

One of the things that really stood out to me is its craftsmanship. The 12-gauge steel body and 1-inch formed door offer unmatched protection and durability. The 8 bolt system, with 5 active bolts, gives me peace of mind knowing my guns are well-protected. Plus, the adjustable shelving allows me to customize the interior to fit my specific needs.

However, there are a few cons to consider. Firstly, while the SP23 is technically capable of holding up to 23 long guns, I've found that in reality, it's more like 12-14 rifles with optics. This is due to the tight packing, which may not be optimal for everyone. Additionally, the price point can be a bit steep for some, as it is on the pricier side for a smaller safe.

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe to anyone looking for a high-quality, compact solution for securing their firearms at home. Its impressive protection features, coupled with its adjustable interior, make it a top choice for gun owners seeking both accessibility and security.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1"><img alt="provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1/public"/></a></div>

The Flex shelving system definitely stands out, allowing you to customize the interior to fit your specific storage needs, whether for long-guns or a combination of firearms and other valuables. The door panel offers extra storage for handguns and additional valuables, further enhancing its versatility.

I recently got my hands on the Mossy Oak 18 Gun Security Cabinet, and boy, has it made a difference in my home! This cabinet is like a fortress for my firearms. Made of heavy-duty steel and rust-resistant powder coating, it's built to last.

One of the things that really stood out for me was its beveled front edge and multiple interior configuration options.

### [In-Wall Home Defense Mirror with Gun Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=in-wall-home-defense-mirror-with-gun-storage)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=tactical-walls-in-wall-home-defense-mirror-1"><img alt="tactical-walls-in-wall-home-defense-mirror-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-walls-in-wall-home-defense-mirror-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Tactical Walls In-Wall Home Defense Mirror in my living room, and I couldn't be happier with it. Not only does it look like a stylish full-length wall mirror, but it also doubles as a hidden storage compartment for my rifles and handguns. The sliding, locking mechanism is easy to use and secure, providing peace of mind that my firearms are safely out of reach from curious hands.

The wood construction is sturdy and well-crafted, giving it a high-quality feel. However, I did have a bit of trouble installing it, as the screws provided aren't the best fit for some walls (just like one reviewer mentioned). I replaced them with flat-head screws and that seemed to fix the issue.

One aspect that I was initially concerned about was the lighting quality behind the mirror. Fortunately, it isn't an issue at all, as the mirror reflects the room's natural light and creates a warm, inviting appearance. The hidden compartments are spacious enough to store several firearms, but I would recommend using extra Velcro or mounts to keep them securely in place, as some reviewers mentioned that their firearms occasionally fell off the backplane.

Overall, the Tactical Walls In-Wall Home Defense Mirror has added not only a unique decorative touch to my home but also an additional layer of security and convenience for my family. It's an attractive, well-built product that performs its intended function beautifully – and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.

### [Tactical Walls Recessed In-Wall Gun Mirror Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mirror-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=mirror-gun-safes&utm_term=tactical-walls-recessed-in-wall-gun-mirror-storage)

I recently installed this tactical wall mirror in my home and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The sleek and sophisticated design easily blends with the home decor, making it an ideal choice for individuals who prioritize discretion and convenience. The mirror is made of high-quality wood, ABS plastic, and a real glass mirror, giving it a sturdy and durable feel.

One of the standout features of this mirror is its sliding, locking mechanism. It's so ingenious that it took me by surprise. The mirror is mounted in the wall between the studs, and at first glance, it appears just like any other wall mirror. However, a simple magnetic key disengages the hidden lock, and voila! There you have access to two compartments for storing your handguns and other essentials.

On the downside, the instructions are a bit lacking in detail. It would be great to have more comprehensive instructions to assist with the installation process. Also, the magnetic key could be stronger to hold larger items. Despite these minor hiccups, I am thoroughly impressed with the quality, craftsmanship, and innovative design of this tactical wall mirror.

The exterior vault-style hinges are super sturdy too, allowing for full access into the safe while providing added protection.

However, one minor issue that I encountered was with the electronic combination. It wasn't as user-friendly as I would have liked it to be, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.

All in all, I am extremely happy with the Winchester Ranger 54 Gun Safe. Its sturdy construction, reliable security features, and ample storage make it a worthwhile investment for any gun owner.
