The Blackhawk Tecgrip Holsters have been an excellent addition to my collection. The SERPA Auto Lock technology is an impressive feature, ensuring that my firearm remains securely in place while only disengaging during the draw cycle, giving me peace of mind. The Speed Cut Aids are also a great design as they allow for rapid draw and target acquisition.

This holster’s versatility stands out with its adjustable cant and inclusion of both a belt loop and paddle platform, allowing me to customize how I carry depending on the situation. Additionally, the passive retention detent adjustment screw lets me make minor changes for a perfect fit.

I really appreciate the thin profile of this holster; it's comfortable against my body and doesn't add any extra bulk, perfect for concealment purposes. Plus, having an adjustable cant gives me additional control over how I wear my holster - whether tilted forward or backward – making sure it fits just right for my personal preferences.

### [Hybrid Leather & Kydex Holster for Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=hybrid-leather-kydex-holster-for-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/public"/></a></div>

Ah, my Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat. This is not just another holster; it's a daily companion that's been with me through thick and thin. The blend of Kydex's precise retention and leather's comfort is a match made in heaven. No more break-in time, just smooth and secure draw and re-holster.

One thing I particularly love about this holster is its versatility. Whether I'm carrying it AIWB, IWB, or OWB, it never fails to adapt. The adjustable cant allows me to position it just right for a comfortable draw, and the ambidextrous design lets both lefties and righties carry in their preferred hand positioning.

As a bonus, this holster is handmade to perfection at MFT facilities right here in the USA. Talk about a labor of love!

However, it does have its quirks. I've noticed that the screws tend to loosen up more frequently than I'd like, causing occasional discomfort. Also, be prepared for some visible wear over time, but then again, isn't that part of the journey with any EDC tool?

All in all, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat has been a solid addition to my EDC arsenal. It offers a perfect blend of comfort, versatility, and adjustability that makes it stand out among other holsters.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-hellcat-pro-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro and it's been a game-changer in my daily carry routine. This modern holster is incredibly versatile, designed to fit almost any use. Its ambidextrous design makes it perfect for both left and right-handed shooters, and it easily adapts to outside waistband (OWB) or inside waistband (IWB) use.

One feature that particularly stands out is its optimized appendix carry configuration, complete with an included wing for enhanced concealment. I've also found the optional sidecar mag carrier incredibly useful, adding an extra layer of convenience and readiness to my carry.

However, what truly sets this holster apart is its compatibility with various optics, including the ever-popular Hellcat Pro. The built-in optic cut ensures a perfect fit and smooth draw, regardless of the optic you choose, except for the SRO.

Made right here in the USA, the Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro comes with a lifetime warranty, reflecting the brand's confidence in their product's durability and quality.

While I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and flexibility, I must admit that the initial installation process might be a bit daunting for some. However, once you've got it set up, it's smooth sailing from there.

Overall, I would say that the Alien Gear Holsters Photon Optics-Ready Holster - Hellcat Pro is a well-rounded and highly adaptable holster that has more than earned its spot in my daily carry lineup.

### [Modular Holster System for Springfield Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=modular-holster-system-for-springfield-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-springfield-hellcat-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System for my Springfield Hellcat, and I have to say, it's been quite an adventure. The ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers a quick and easy way to transform your holster into four distinct carrying styles - IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster. What I found most interesting is how versatile it can be. However, it can get quite bulky, which might not appeal to all users. The thumb release is also a bit of a challenge to push down and feels a bit wobbly. Though, I must admit, the holster looks great with my Springfield Hellcat.

Despite its bulky design, the ShapeShift's modularity is a major plus. It caters to different carrying preferences and is made in the USA, which is a testament to its quality. Overall, it's a versatile and convenient holster system that might not suit everyone's taste, but it definitely has its own unique charm.

### [Versacarry Compound OWB Holster for Right-Handed Users](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-compound-owb-holster-for-right-handed-users)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1"><img alt="versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-compound-owb-holster-rh-size-1-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first received the Versacarry Brown Leather OWB Holster, I was excited to try it out. The first time I used it, I noticed the comfort it provided - the polymer lining truly does make a difference. I found that it fits nicely on my belt, and the open-top allows for quick access to my firearm. The right-handed orientation was perfect for me, but it's worth noting that it might not be the best fit for lefties.

One standout aspect of the Versacarry Brown Leather OWB Holster is its build quality. Being handcrafted in America, you can really tell it's made with care and precision. The combination of water buffalo leather and carbon fiber finish not only looks great but also feels high-quality.

However, one minor issue I experienced was that, after prolonged use, my firearm began to stick slightly to the holster material. This wasn't a significant problem and may just be a case of needing some elbow grease or silicone spray to remedy.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the Versacarry Compound OWB Holster RH Size 1 Brown. Its comfort, right-handed design, and made-in-America craftsmanship are definite highlights. If you're in the market for a new gun holster, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.

### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=seizmik-icos-silent-secure-in-cab-seat-gun-holder)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=car-gun-holsters&utm_term=seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.
