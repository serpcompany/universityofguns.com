My experience with the Cannon TS5722 20+4 gun fire-resistant safe has been excellent. I was impressed with the interior luxury, which includes soft materials to prevent scratches, and the adjustable shelving system made organizing my valuables a breeze. The factory-installed door organization kit holds up my pistols securely, providing extra peace of mind.

The heavy-duty construction is another standout feature - it includes a solid steel unibody design, three 1" diameter steel live-action locking bolts, and TruLock internal hinge system that prevents pry attacks. This adds to my confidence in the product's ability to protect my belongings from potential thieves or fires.

Although storage capacity is ample for essential items like documents or jewelry along with weapons, fitting the maximum advertised number of firearms might be challenging due to space constraints. The electronic lock comes with a backup key for emergencies; however, some users have reported occasional difficulty getting all long guns inside without crowding them together and a relatively small interior depth.

Despite these minor issues, this safe provides great value for money considering its high-quality build combined with security features such as Triple Fin seal protection against drill attacks – making it perfect not only for those looking to protect their valuables but also those seeking a reliable solution to store their firearm collection safely away from children's reach while remaining easily accessible when needed most!

### [DIY 8-Gun Cabinet with Sturdy Steel Construction](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/small-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="surelock-combat-8-gun-diy-cabinet-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-combat-8-gun-diy-cabinet-black-1/public"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I was excited to get my hands on this gun cabinet to keep my firearms safely secure. Upon opening the package, I noticed that it's constructed with a sturdy 21-gauge steel body and 19-gauge steel door - both providing ample protection for my valuables. The SureLock 3-point locking system adds an extra layer of security against potential break-ins.

Setting up the cabinet was relatively easy as it came with detailed instructions and all necessary hardware. However, one challenge I faced was finding enough space for storing larger shotguns due to height restrictions on the shelves included within. Additionally, while the interior barrel rests were already installed and made organizing guns effortless, there could be improvements to the internal organization for better accessibility - for example, adjustable shelves or additional compartments would be a welcome addition.

While this is not a fireproof safe, it does provide adequate impact resistance and can be bolted down securely using the provided hardware (not included). Overall, I believe this gun cabinet serves its purpose well at an affordable price point while offering good value for money spent on keeping your guns secure at home. However, some enhancements in terms of design and added features would make it stand out amongst competitor products in its class. \xa0
