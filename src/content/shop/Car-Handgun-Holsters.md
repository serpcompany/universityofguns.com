The Blackhawk Tecgrip Holsters have been an excellent addition to my collection. The SERPA Auto Lock technology is an impressive feature, ensuring that my firearm remains securely in place while only disengaging during the draw cycle, giving me peace of mind. The Speed Cut Aids are also a great design as they allow for rapid draw and target acquisition.

This holster’s versatility stands out with its adjustable cant and inclusion of both a belt loop and paddle platform, allowing me to customize how I carry depending on the situation. Additionally, the passive retention detent adjustment screw lets me make minor changes for a perfect fit.

I really appreciate the thin profile of this holster; it's comfortable against my body and doesn't add any extra bulk, perfect for concealment purposes. Plus, having an adjustable cant gives me additional control over how I wear my holster - whether tilted forward or backward – making sure it fits just right for my personal preferences.

Overall, I'm satisfied with this product as it delivers on its promises: high-quality construction combined with innovative features such as SERPA Auto Lock technology provide confidence when carrying your firearm safely and securely throughout your daily routine!

### [Secure IWB Holster Mount for Vehicles, Desk, and Nightstand Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the IWB Holster Mount and have been using it daily for a few weeks now. This product has truly transformed my daily carry experience, offering both convenience and peace of mind. The mount securely holds my holstered firearm in place, whether I'm at my office desk or driving in my truck. Its dual locking design provides assurance that the weapon won't fall out, even on bumpy roads.

One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost! With its lightweight design and dual locking mechanism, you can rest assured that your firearm remains safe and secure while on-the-go or stored away when not needed.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-sw-shield-9-40-2-0-bl-1/public"/></a></div>

As someone who has recently started carrying concealed, I must say that the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack S&W Shield 9/40 & 2.0 Bl! has been quite an exciting introduction to the world of holsters.

The Core Carry Pack is truly a one-stop solution for all my holstering needs. In just minutes, I can transform this little gadget into an IWB (inside waistband) holster, an appendix carry holster, an OWB (outside waistband) belt slide, or even an OWB paddle holster thanks to its modular design. It's kind of like Lego for grown-ups, but with more serious applications!

To accompany this versatile holster, the Core Carry Pack also comes with a bonus Holster Mount which allows me to attach my ShapeShift onto a variety of surfaces within seconds. This is perfect for those days when I need to switch between carrying my gun and not - less hassle, more convenience.

However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The only drawback I experienced with this product was its size. I found the OWB holster to be quite bulky, making it a bit impractical for casual, everyday use. It definitely felt more suitable for professionals like security personnel or law enforcement officers who need to carry their weapons concealed at all times.

Moreover, while the concept of having adjustable retention is a brilliant idea in theory, it can be a bit confusing for users who are new to modular holsters. The thumb release on the holster could also use some improvement as it tends to get stuck occasionally.

Overall, despite these minor issues, I am quite satisfied with my ShapeShift. It offers great flexibility and convenience, making it easy for me to switch between different carrying styles depending on my mood or outfit for the day. For anyone looking to invest in a high-quality modular holster system, I would definitely recommend giving the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack a shot!

### [Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes Handgun Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/public"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my handgun storage solution, and it's been a game-changer. Before, I had to stack my firearms on the shelves, which not only took up a lot of space but also sometimes scratched their finishes. Now, with these clever holsters, I can store all of my handguns securely and make the most of the space inside my gun safe.

One of the main highlights of these holsters is their ease of use. Simply attach the Velcro side to a carpeted wall, insert your handgun, and boom! You've got a secure and accessible storage solution. No more clutter or scratched finishes, and best of all, no more stacking.

However, I did experience a minor inconvenience while installing these holsters. The screws that came with them were too short for my metal-door safe, so I had to visit Home Depot to purchase longer ones. Additionally, I would have preferred if the Velcro on the back of the holsters came with a plus or "X" pattern to eliminate any wobbling. But overall, these holsters have been a fantastic addition to my gun safe.

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters provide a simple and effective solution for storing handguns in your gun safe. With their easy installation and accessibility, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them. So, if you're looking for a way to clear up some space and secure your handguns, I highly recommend giving these holsters a try.

### [Hybrid Holster for Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer when it comes to carrying my handgun. This hybrid holster combines the best of both worlds - the precision and secure retention of Kydex with the comfort and natural feel of authentic American full-grain leather.

What really stood out to me was the adjustable cant feature, which allowed me to change the angle of my holster between 0-15 degrees for a perfect fit. The ambidextrous hole patterns made it easy for both right and left-handed users to find the perfect position to carry their gun. And as someone who constantly wears a holster, the comfort level it provides is unmatched.

The holster is also RMR compatible, meaning you can easily attach an additional red dot sight for increased accuracy. The 1.5" belt clip ensures a secure connection to your belt, and the adjustable retention with an audible click offers peace of mind every time you draw and re-holster your weapon.

However, there are a couple of cons I want to address. I experienced some issues with the screws coming loose, especially during intense activities like running or jumping. Additionally, I noticed that the holster tends to wear out faster than expected, making it less durable than I initially hoped.

Overall, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black offers a comfortable and versatile solution for concealed carry. While it does have some room for improvement in terms of screw durability and overall longevity, I believe that this holster is definitely worth considering for those looking for a reliable everyday carry option.
