The solid wood and wood veneers construction gives it a high-quality appearance, and the air hole in the bottom compartment ensures proper circulation for stored items.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/closet-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=closet-gun-safes&utm_term=5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/public"/></a></div>

Man, I've been using this 5 Gun Safe from American Furniture Classics for quite some time now. I've got to say, it's been a real game-changer in securing my firearms. The 3-directional bolt system along with the soft foam pad at the bottom has proved to be a real lifesaver when it comes to keeping my valuables safely stowed away.

One of the standout features for me has been the high strength steel construction. This thing is an absolute beast, providing me with an unmatched level of security. It's also got holes for mounting to the wall and floor, which gives me peace of mind knowing that it's going nowhere.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The keyed access can be a bit of a pain at times, especially when you're in a hurry. And while the high-strength steel is fantastic, the thing is quite heavy, making it a bit of a challenge to move around.

Overall, I've been quite happy with my purchase. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly done a great job of keeping my firearms safe and secure. So if you're in the market for a gun safe, this one's definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/closet-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=closet-gun-safes&utm_term=american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet in black, and I have to say, it's been a game changer for me. I had been looking for a safe and secure way to store my long guns and handguns, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy, high-end safe. That's where this little cabinet came in.

The first thing that caught my eye was the two separate compartments. I could fit five long guns in the bottom compartment and have a separate section for my handguns and ammunition up top. The three-point locking system gave me an added sense of security, knowing that my firearms were protected against unauthorized access.

Once I got the cabinet home and assembled, I was impressed with the quality of the materials. The powder-coated steel was sturdy, and the soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor added an extra layer of protection for my guns. I also appreciated the fact that the cabinet came fully assembled, so all I had to do was mount it to the wall – no complicated assembly required.

However, there were a few downsides to this cabinet as well. The main issue was that it wasn't very heavy or sturdy, which made me worry that a determined thief might be able to carry it away if they gained access to my home. Additionally, I noticed that the paint chipped off in a few spots, which was a little disappointing considering the quality of the materials.

Overall, I would highly recommend the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to anyone looking for a secure and affordable way to store their firearms. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done and provides peace of mind, knowing that my guns are safe and protected.

Locked and loaded - that's how my collection of firearms feels when tucked away safely in my new VEVOR 3 Rifles Gun Safe. I've spent countless nights worrying about the safety of my cherished collection, but not anymore. This sleek and sturdy piece of equipment has brought me peace of mind.

The moment I unboxed it, I could feel its durability. It's made with high-quality steel, and the digital keypad locks it up tight. Even if someone manages to break into the cabinet somehow, they'll be met with a loud alarm that would scare anyone off in a jiffy.

One day when my little one came home from school and went straight to the gun cabinet, my heart skipped a beat. Thankfully, the biometric lock responded promptly to my touch, securing everything within.

However, I discovered that moving around with the safe is quite cumbersome. Its weight makes it challenging to relocate, which might be a hindrance if you're someone who moves frequently.

Despite these minor inconveniences, the VEVOR 3 Rifles Gun Safe has indeed made my life easier. It ensures the safety of my cherished possessions without compromising on quality or design. This firearm lover's dream is now a reality, and I couldn't be happier.

You know what they say, a well-organized gun collection is worth its weight in gold. I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 8 Gun Cabinet, and I must say, it has quickly become a statement piece in my living room.

The first thing that caught my eye was the rich, solid wood and wood veneers. Not only do they give an air of sophistication to the cabinet, but they also add an extra layer of security to my precious firearms. The tempered glass front not only provides a clear view of my collection but also ensures that only I have access to them.

Assembling the cabinet was quite easy, even though the instructions could have been a bit more detailed. However, once everything was in place, I was genuinely impressed with the fit and finish. It looks like it could easily be sold for double the price at any high-end furniture store.

While there's enough room to store up to 8 long guns, I appreciate how the felt-lined butt plates and barrel rests keep them securely in place without causing scratches. The bottom compartment's hinged door provides ample space for storing ammo, handguns, and other accessories, making this cabinet both functional and stylish.

Although the cabinet did require some adjustments during assembly, such as cutting custom pieces of wood for the floor leveling, I'm overall very satisfied with my purchase. The American Furniture Classics 8 Gun Cabinet has successfully transformed a simple storage area into a display of my passion for firearms. If you're looking to enhance your gun collection's aesthetic while keeping it secure and organized, I highly recommend giving this cabinet a try.

### [Versatile 7-Gun Storage Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/closet-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=closet-gun-safes&utm_term=versatile-7-gun-storage-cabinet)

I recently got the Surelock Security Constitutional 7-GUN Cabinet, and I've been using it to store my long guns. I was drawn to it because of its capacity to hold up to seven guns while also being designed for quick access when needed. The organization system has been a game-changer for me. I love how the adjustable barrel rest allows me to store my scoped guns without worrying about damage.

However, there are a few things that could be improved on this cabinet. The thin metal and weak sliders make me slightly concerned about its durability, especially in case of any accidents. The locking mechanism also feels a bit basic, which could be improved for added security. Despite these issues, I've found the cabinet to be a useful addition to my storage solutions.

So, whether you're looking for a cabinet to keep your long guns organized and secure or just need a safe space for your equipment, the Surelock Security Constitutional 7-GUN Cabinet is worth considering. Just remember to handle it with care, as the thin metal could be prone to denting. Overall, I've been happy with my purchase, and I believe it could be a good choice for those in need of a reliable gun cabinet.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/closet-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=closet-gun-safes&utm_term=american-furniture-classics-16-gun-metal-cabinet-1"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-16-gun-metal-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-16-gun-metal-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using the American Furniture Classics 16 Gun Metal Cabinet in my home, and it's definitely worth considering for its balance of style, function, and affordability.

The cabinet boasts a classic black finish with gold trimming, giving it a sophisticated look. The wood grain accents on the interior add a touch of warmth and style that elevates the appearance of this cabinet beyond what you might expect from a simple gun storage solution.

In terms of security, this cabinet comes equipped with a heavy-duty three-bolt locking mechanism and two keys. While it's not fireproof or truly "thief-proof, " it does serve its purpose well by keeping guns out of the hands of children or unauthorized users. I also appreciated the versatile design that allows for either shelving or additional gun storage space on the smaller side of the cabinet.

However, there were a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the assembly process wasn't particularly smooth due to the lack of clear instructions provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, the overall sturdiness of the cabinet could be improved, as some reviewers have reported issues with doors becoming misaligned over time.

Despite these minor concerns, I would recommend the American Furniture Classics 16 Gun Metal Cabinet to anyone looking for an attractive and functional way to store their firearms securely. Its unique blend of style and practicality makes it a solid choice for any home.
