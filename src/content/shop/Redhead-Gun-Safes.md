However, this mighty fortress does have a few quirks. The placement of the LED lights are a tad inconvenient, sometimes casting eerie shadows that can make it hard to locate that specific firearm you're searching for.

### [Wasatch 24 Gun Safe with Electronic Lock & Extra Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/redhead-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I've been using this Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock 24EGW for a few months now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. The fire and water resistance are truly impressive - not many safes can boast of such features. The electronic lock with an alarm U function gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuables are secure from both theft and potential disasters.

One thing that really stands out is the interior door storage. It's been incredibly useful for me, especially since I have a lot of items to store. The 3 live-action locking bolts and 2 dead bolts provide excellent security, making me feel confident that my belongings are well-protected.

However, there are a few cons to consider. First, setting up the electronic lock can be a bit cumbersome at first. Additionally, while the safe is certainly sturdy, it's also quite heavy, which made moving it into my home quite challenging.

Overall, I'm very happy with the Wasatch 24 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock 24EGW. Its unique features, such as the fire and water resistance, electronic lock with an alarm U function, and interior door storage, make it a great choice for those looking to safely store their valuables. Just be prepared for a potentially difficult setup process and a hefty weight if you need to move it around.

As an avid shooter and gun collector, I've had the opportunity to use quite a few gun safes throughout the years. However, none of them have held a candle to the Sports Afield SA5942HX Haven Safe.

This is not just a gun safe, it's a fortress for your firearms and other valuable items. With its 1.5" steel bolts and hardplates, recessed doors, and California CDOJ approval, security is truly top-notch.

One of the features that particularly impressed me was the Deluxe door organization. As someone who loves to keep things organized, being able to store ammo, glasses, and other shooting accessories right on the door is incredibly convenient.

The adjustable shelving is another highlight. Having the flexibility to customize the interior layout based on my specific needs is a game-changer.

One drawback worth mentioning is the weight of the safe. While it's reassuring to know how solidly built it is, moving it around can be quite challenging, especially if you're not used to handling heavy objects.

Another minor issue I encountered was with the keypad. The sticker on the keypad was not clearly marked as needing to be removed, which led to some confusion during setup. However, this was easily resolved with a quick online search.

All in all, the Sports Afield SA5942HX Haven Safe is an excellent choice for anyone looking to secure their firearms and other valuables. Its robust construction, customizable features, and proven security make it a worthwhile investment.

One of the things that really stood out for me was its beveled front edge and multiple interior configuration options. My collection includes long guns and scoped rifles, and this cabinet accommodates them perfectly with molded barrel rests and scoped rifle standoffs. Plus, the 3-point lock and full-hinge door add an extra layer of security to keep my guns safe from prying hands.

The high-quality EVA foam liners are a game changer. They protect my guns from scratches and ensure they stay in pristine condition. And with dimensions of 21 in. x 18 in. x 55 in. , it has plenty of space to store my entire collection.

However, no product is perfect, and this cabinet does have a few cons. The instructions could use some improvement - they weren't as clear as I'd hoped. And while it's definitely sturdy, it could be a bit more robust in terms of weight.

Overall, I'm incredibly pleased with the Mossy Oak 18 Gun Security Cabinet. It's perfect for keeping my firearms organized and secure while also looking sleek and stylish in my home.

One feature that really stands out is the UL-listed ProLogic SecuRam lock. It's not just secure - it's incredibly easy to use. The custom combo options make it super convenient for me to access my guns when I need them.

### [Stylish modern hide a bed chair](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/redhead-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I've been using the Browning Rawhide 33 Standard Gun Safe for a while now, and I must say, it's been a sturdy companion.

The faux leather-trimmed interior is a nice touch too, adding a touch of rugged class to the overall look and feel of the safe.

However, I did feel a bit let down by the capacity of the safe. Despite being rated for 33 long guns, I was only able to comfortably fit around 20, which was quite a disappointment. In general, this is a high-quality gun safe with some exceptional features, but just keep in mind that you might need a little extra space if you're planning on storing an extensive collection.

The adjustable shelving system, collector barrel racks, and auxiliary shelves allowed me to customize the interior, ensuring that every single one of my guns had a designated space.

Additionally, its bright white LED lighting made it incredibly easy to navigate through my collection even in low light conditions.

However, one minor con to note is the weight of the safe. At 1,080 pounds, it was quite challenging to move it into position on my own. It's definitely something to keep in mind when considering where you'll place your safe in your home.
