Having used the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System for a few weeks now, I must say that it has truly impressed me. This 5. 0-rated product is highly versatile and can accommodate a range of gun sizes including full-sized, compact, and subcompact pistols. Its design works with any size IWB holster and provides added security through retention via its belt loop feature.

A standout feature of the belly band holster system is its breathable aeroprene strap, which ensures comfort even during extended wear in hot weather conditions. Another plus for me was its ability to support both right-handed and left-handed draws – a useful feature that adds much value to the product as it eliminates the need for additional accessories like holsters or straps.

Some of the pros of this holster system include: 1) Versatility - Fits any IWB holster and accommodates different gun sizes; 2) Comfort - Breathable material making it wearable all day long; 3) Retention & Concealment – Provides secure retention while allowing effective concealment under clothing or other garments; 4) Adjustability - Easy adjustments allow for a custom fit according to individual preferences; 5) Suitable for both right- and left-handed shooters.

There aren't many downsides to this product, but some users may find there is slight learning curve due to lack of detailed instructions on how best set up the system for maximum efficiency - though trial & error can quickly solve any issues here. Overall, if you’re looking for a reliable, comfortable, and concealed carry holster solution, then STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System is definitely worth considering as it offers great value in terms of versatility and security without sacrificing comfort or convenience.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-trainer-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-trainer-gun-holsters&utm_term=clip-carry-strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-system-holster-pocket-l-xl-str-tac-l-xl-1"><img alt="clip-carry-strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-system-holster-pocket-l-xl-str-tac-l-xl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/clip-carry-strapt-tac-belly-band-holster-system-holster-pocket-l-xl-str-tac-l-xl-1/public"/></a></div>

The STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System from Clip and Carry US has been my go-to for concealed carry over the last few months. One major highlight is the aeroprene strap, which is incredibly comfortable even on hot summer days. I’ve also found it to be very versatile, as it works with any size pistol and any size inside-the-waistband holster.

I appreciate the excellent retention and concealment that this product provides. My pistol has stayed secure all day long in various situations, whether I’m walking, sitting or running (not a common occurrence for me! ). This is particularly helpful as I carry a full-sized pistol. The breathable strap ensures easy access to my firearm when needed while keeping it in place throughout the day.

This belly band holster system is highly adaptable - you can use any of your existing IWB holsters with it without buying additional accessories. Additionally, Clip & Carry US' customer service team deserves praise for their knowledge and willingness to help customers make informed decisions before purchasing their products.

While this product excels in comfortability, versatility, ease of use and affordability; there are some areas for improvement. For instance, more variety in sizing options would cater to a broader range of body types, ensuring an even better fit for everyone who uses this holster system. However, despite these small drawbacks, the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System remains one of my top choices for reliable concealed carry solutions that offer security and flexibility at an affordable price point. ”

They're great for stashing your ID, cash, and keys, and even doubles as a phone holder.

Now, the holster is compatible with all sorts of firearms, making it a perfect choice for both left and right-handed individuals. Additionally, the adjustable size means it can fit waist sizes ranging from 26" to 52", covering most body types.

I've been using the Caldwell Tac Ops Belly Band Holster for a few months now and I have to say, it's one of the most comfortable holsters I've ever worn. The high-quality, moisture-wicking material keeps me dry even in hot weather. Plus, the slide protection tab ensures that my firearm stays away from my skin while still being easily accessible.

One of the best features of this holster is its versatility. Not only can it hold my handgun securely, but it also doubles as a cell phone holder, magazine holder, or flashlight holder. This makes it perfect for both everyday carry and for travel. And when it's time to clean it, simply throw it in the washing machine and you're good to go.

However, no product is perfect, and there are a few cons to consider with this holster. First, the elastic material may start to wear down after a year or so of daily use. Second, some users have reported that their magazine can fall out if not secured properly.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Caldwell Tac Ops Belly Band Holster for anyone looking for a comfortable, versatile, and easy-to-use holster. Its moisture-wicking material and wide elastic pockets make it perfect for nearly any situation.

### [Sticky Holsters Velcro-Adjustable Hideout Belly Band](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-trainer-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-trainer-gun-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holsters-velcro-adjustable-hideout-belly-band)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-trainer-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-trainer-gun-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holsters-belly-band-xxl-43-66"><img alt="sticky-holsters-belly-band-xxl-43-66" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sticky-holsters-belly-band-xxl-43-66/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65", and I must say it's a game-changer for those looking for comfortable and secure concealed carry options. The elastic construction of this belly band provides both strength and comfort, ensuring you won't feel restricted while wearing it.

One of the standout features for me was the "Sticky" material, which kept the band firmly in place without any movement or adjustments needed throughout the day. The built-in accessory pockets are also incredibly useful - they easily fit my spare magazine and folding knife, while the larger pocket accommodates my wallet, phone, and more.

Using this belly band as a travel band to discreetly store important documents has also been a lifesaver, especially when working out or going through crowded areas. The only downside I experienced was the lack of a built-in holster, but that is easily remedied by using a Sticky Holster in conjunction with the band.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sticky Holsters Belly Band XXL 43-65" for anyone in need of a versatile and comfortable concealed carry option that truly stands out from the competition.

### [Comfortable & Convenient Belly Band Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-trainer-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-trainer-gun-holsters&utm_term=comfortable-convenient-belly-band-gun-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/waist-trainer-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=waist-trainer-gun-holsters&utm_term=belly-band-gun-holster-1"><img alt="belly-band-gun-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/belly-band-gun-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out this belly band gun holster, and I must say I've been thoroughly impressed by its performance. This holster is made of premium neoprene material, which is not only incredibly soft and comfortable but also very durable and breathable.

The highlight of the holster for me is its convenience and multifunctionality. The holster has a pistol pocket, an independent magazine clip, and an extra pocket, making it extremely easy to attach and detach your gun. Moreover, the metal buttons on the holster provide an added layer of safety by ensuring that your gun stays securely in place.

One downside I noticed with this holster was the "snap" hardware's quality or user-friendliness. It's easy to unsnap when drawing your weapon, but challenging to re-snap it back on while wearing the belly band. Another potential issue is the lack of a chafing guard to prevent the exposed part of the gun from rubbing against your belly. Lastly, some left-handed users might find the holster's design less suitable for their needs.

Despite these minor issues, I found the belly band gun holster to be an excellent value for the money. Its comfortable and breathable fabric, combined with its multi-functionality and secure hold, makes it a worthwhile option for those seeking a reliable way to carry their firearms.

I've been using Rounded Gear's Belly Band Holster for a few weeks now and it's been a game-changer for me. This holster is made of high-quality neoprene which is moisture-wicking and breathable, making it perfect for warmer climates or prolonged use. The wide elastic pockets provide support not only for your handgun but also for weapon-mounted lights and lasers.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the slide protection tab that keeps your firearm away from your skin, preventing any discomfort or rubbing. It's also machine washable, which is a huge plus in terms of cleaning. The size chart allows you to choose the best fit for your waist size, ensuring comfort throughout the day.

However, there have been some issues with retention, as the holster area doesn't narrow at the bottom and lacks a strap to secure your firearm further. I suggest looking into a holster with a safety strap for added security. Additionally, I've noticed some tearing and stretching in the supposedly breathable area, which may affect its longevity.

Overall, the Rounded Gear Belly Band Holster offers great comfort and support for everyday carry, but improvements could be made to address concerns regarding retention and durability. With a more secure design, this would be a top choice for anyone seeking a belly band holster.

I decided to give the Galco Underwraps Belly Band 2.0 in Khaki a shot to see what all the hype was about. As a belly band for concealed carry, it was a completely new experience for me. The material is made of an elasticized nylon, which provides comfort and flexibility while worn. I loved how it could accommodate my medium-sized handgun without any issues, and it even has enough space for extra ammo or other accessories.

However, one thing that didn't sit well with me was how tight the belt was. During my usage, it felt more like an uncomfortable hug instead of a discreet solution for concealed carry. I had to return it to the store, as it wasn't working out for me. While this product may suit others perfectly, I personally found it a bit too snug for comfort. Overall, it's a versatile band with many benefits, but the tightness may be a deal-breaker for some.
