### [Rugged Leather Holster for Ruger Security Six Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="ruger-security-six-revolver-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ruger-security-six-revolver-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently started using this rugged, full grain leather holster made for Ruger double action Six revolvers and I must say, it has truly exceeded my expectations. The quality of the English Bridle leather is exceptional and the distressed brown Crazy Horse Water Buffalo leather adds a unique touch to its appearance.

One of the standout features for me is how well it fits my Ruger Security Six like a glove, providing great protection and keeping debris out of the barrel. The retaining strap ensures that my revolver stays securely in place while allowing easy access when needed.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this high-quality holster and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a reliable and durable option for their revolver. As much as I love this product, I do wish there were more color options available to match different personal styles.

### [LockLeather OWB Hybrid Kydex Holster with Retention Clip and Magazine Carrier](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owb-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Lock Leather Magazine and OWB Open/Concealed Carry Click Retention Hybrid Kydex Holster for my firearm and I am very pleased with its performance. The integrated LockLeather retention clip and the additional magazine carrier with retention screw have been game changers in terms of security and reliability when carrying my weapon. The thin profile of the holster ensures that it hugs my firearm close to my body, making concealed carry a breeze.

A standout feature that deserves mentioning is comfort - from day one, this adaptable leather has provided unparalleled comfort while curving to my body shape. The heavy-duty nylon stitching, reinforced steel hardware and leather accents throughout further add to the holster's exceptional quality. Its ideal angle allows me to draw my gun without any hassle or effort, which can be extremely handy in certain situations.

One minor downside is that it's slightly longer than necessary for me personally; however, as someone who works with leather myself, I was able to trim it down to a more suitable length so that it doesn’t pop out when leaning over or performing other movements.

Overall, I am highly satisfied with this product as it offers me a secure way to carry my firearm while maintaining a low-profile appearance. And with its 4. 5-star rating from over 7000 reviews, you can trust that you are getting a reliable product worth investing in!

### [Covert OWB Belt Holster for Beretta M9A3/M9A4 - Left Hand Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gp-100-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-beretta-m9a3-m9a4-left-hand-black-2751-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-beretta-m9a3-m9a4-left-hand-black-2751-101/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has used the Beretta M9A3 Kydex holster by C&G Holsters, I'm happy to say that it exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Kydex material and craftsmanship is top-notch, evident as soon as you hold this holster in your hands. It fits my Beretta M9A3 snugly and securely, allowing for smooth draws with ease.

The retention on the holster is outstanding; there's no wobble or movement of the gun when inserted, yet it releases with just enough resistance to ensure its security until needed. Additionally, the design allows for easy concealment without any discomfort.

What really impressed me was the attention to detail in the finish quality of this holster's edges and overall design. I have owned several Kydex holsters from different manufacturers before, but none have come close to matching the precision and care put into making this one by C&G Holsters.

While there are no major cons with this product, one suggestion for improvement could be offering an option for a QLS attachment as well as smaller belt loop sizes for those who prefer narrower belts. However, these minor points don't take away from how fantastic this product is overall. Based on my experience with this holster, I would highly recommend C&G Holsters to anyone searching for a high-quality Kydex holster that delivers in both performance and comfort!

I recently had the opportunity to test and review the C&G Beretta 92FS/96/M9A3/Vertec OWB Covert Kydex Holster, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. The first thing that truly impressed me was the precision build quality of this holster - the edges were smooth, clean, and perfectly fit together with a high level of detail. Additionally, the gun print on the outside adds an extra touch of style.

The gun retention is also top-notch; there's a satisfying click when locking your firearm in place which gives you confidence it will stay secure even during intense activities. Drawing from this holster was smooth yet firm, allowing for quick accessibility without compromising safety. In terms of comfort and concealment, C&G did not disappoint either - the Kydex holster hugs tightly against your body without movement or wobbling once adjusted to your preferred position on your belt loop. Its lightweight design also reduces fatigue throughout extended wear time compared with heavier options available elsewhere on market today!

One area for improvement could be offering an option for QLS attachment, but overall great job by C&G team in providing attention towards craftsmanship while delivering high-quality results along with impressive customer service shown through fast delivery timescales too!

As a user who values comfort and durability in a holster, I was impressed with C&G's Covert OWB Kydex Holster. The holster is made in America by veterans and law enforcement officers, instilling confidence in its quality.

The Kydex material feels robust and dependable, providing solid locking retention for my Glock 43. It's designed to fit most RMR/Red Dots on the market and has an open bottom that accommodates threaded barrels and compensators. The sleek matte black finish adds to its professional appearance.

The holster is exceptionally comfortable to wear throughout the day, staying securely in place without shifting or moving around while sitting down or standing up. It also keeps my pistol close to my body, making it easy to conceal under loose clothing without being noticeable.

Although I had to make some modifications for better fitment around the mag release due to personal preference, overall I found this holster well-made and well-designed for daily use. With features like ease of setup and attachment mount type options (belt loop/slot), this is a versatile option for anyone looking for a comfortable carry solution for their Glock 43 or similar model firearm.

As a gun owner, I understand the importance of having a high-quality holster that not only protects my weapon but also allows for smooth and swift draws. That's why I decided to give the Dual Position Phoenix Holster by Galco a try. From the moment I received it, I was impressed with its construction - made from premium saddle leather and lined with silicone suede for added protection. The adjustable tension screw allowed me to customize the fit to my handgun, ensuring that it stays securely in place while still being easily accessible.

One of my favorite features is the versatile carry positions - strong side or crossdraw - which makes it perfect for anyone who prefers having options when carrying their firearm. The thumb break snap provides an additional layer of security and can be adjusted for a quick release if needed. The attention to detail and customer service provided by Mad City is unmatched, adding even more value to this already great product!

However, one potential downside is that some people may find the sight rails to be less protective than expected since they do not cover every part of the sights completely. But overall, this exceptional sportsman’s holster has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and functionality, making it an excellent choice for gun owners looking for reliable protection with smooth accessibility!

The wide belt slots and customizable options make it versatile and suitable for users with different needs or preferences.

However, there are areas where the Ruger Gp100 Leather Holster can improve upon; like adding additional features to enhance the user experience further. Overall, this holster has earned its 5-star rating from me due to its exceptional functionality and durable build quality but could benefit from some updates to appeal to a broader range of users.
