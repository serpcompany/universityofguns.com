### [Safe and Efficient Cutting with Stanley's Retractable Utility Knife](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=safe-and-efficient-cutting-with-stanleys-retractable-utility-knife)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=stanley-self-retracting-safety-blade-utility-knife-1"><img alt="stanley-self-retracting-safety-blade-utility-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stanley-self-retracting-safety-blade-utility-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

The Stanley 10-189C safety knife has been a game-changer for me, providing a safe and efficient cutting experience in various tasks around the house and at work. The standout feature is the spring-loaded blade retractability, ensuring accidental cuts are prevented. Plus, the bright orange color ensures great visibility in any environment.

The contoured handle with textured die-cast body provides maximum grip and control, reducing the risk of slips and injuries. Although, I did find it slightly annoying that when retracting the blade automatically, you have to keep your thumb on the slider to hold it out.

This safety knife is an excellent choice for those working with heavy boxes or fast-paced environments due to its secure design and added safety features. However, if you're looking for a knife for craftsman use or longer cuts where you might want to be able to hold it in different ways, this might not be suitable as it only works effectively with that one blade position enabled by your thumb constantly pushing down on the slider button.

Overall, this is an ideal tool for anyone looking for a reliable tool with a focus on safety in their everyday cutting tasks. If you appreciate good construction quality and visible color that stands out in crowded situations, then look no further than this Stanley Safety Knife!

### [Crescent Wiss - Retractable Safety Utility Knife](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=crescent-wiss-retractable-safety-utility-knife)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=crescent-wiss-auto-retracting-safety-knife-mens-size-one-size-1"><img alt="crescent-wiss-auto-retracting-safety-knife-mens-size-one-size-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crescent-wiss-auto-retracting-safety-knife-mens-size-one-size-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Crescent Wiss's Auto-Retracting Safety Utility Knife, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in my daily cutting tasks. The first thing that caught my eye was its ergonomic design, which made it incredibly comfortable to hold and maneuver. The quick blade change system is also an absolute breeze to use, saving me plenty of time and effort.

One of the standout features of this knife is its automatic blade retraction. As soon as it loses contact with the material being cut, the blade retracts automatically, even if I'm still holding the blade slider forward. This has significantly reduced the risk of accidents in my workplace, leading to less downtime and increased productivity.

It's also compatible with all standard utility knife blades, which means I can customize it to suit my needs. Plus, the blade storage compartment in the handle is a real bonus, ensuring I always have a spare blade handy when I need it.

However, there is one con to this otherwise excellent tool - the blade change system can be a bit tricky to master at first. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.

Overall, the Crescent Wiss's Auto-Retracting Safety Utility Knife has been a reliable and efficient addition to my toolbox. Its safety features and ease of use make it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable utility knife.

### [Winkler Knives WKII Belt Knife - Black Micarta](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=winkler-knives-wkii-belt-knife-black-micarta)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=winkler-knives-wkii-belt-knife-black-micarta-1"><img alt="winkler-knives-wkii-belt-knife-black-micarta-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winkler-knives-wkii-belt-knife-black-micarta-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Winkler Knives WKII Belt Knife in my daily life and I must say, it's a true workhorse. The 4.75-inch carbon steel drop point blade with its no-glare finish and thumb jimping is perfect for the toughest tasks. The full tang construction ensures its durability, while the black micarta handles provide a comfortable grip even in wet conditions.

One thing I particularly enjoy about this knife is its versatile carrying options. The black leather belt sheath allows me to either clip it for vertical or horizontal carry or use the optional MOLLE loop attachment. Plus, it's made right here in the USA, which is always a bonus.

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. The blade could be thinner for more precision work, and the lack of a safety lock might concern some potential buyers. But overall, if you're looking for a reliable and robust belt knife, the Winkler Knives WKII Belt Knife is definitely worth considering.

### [Lightweight Tanto Boot Knife - Cold Steel Kobun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=lightweight-tanto-boot-knife-cold-steel-kobun)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=cold-steel-kobun-1"><img alt="cold-steel-kobun-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cold-steel-kobun-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who got the chance to use the Cold Steel Kobun, I can say that it's a perfect blend of style and function. This little tanto-styled boot knife, inspired by Japanese martial arts, is designed with a thin blade that's reinforced right up to the tip to prevent any potential bending or breaking. The Kraton handle offers a firm grip, despite its minimalistic size, allowing for secure handling even during intense situations.

However, it's the Kobun's Secure-Ex sheath that truly impresses. This sturdy sheath ensures safe and secure storage of the knife, yet allows for quick and easy release when needed. Plus, it is designed to accommodate a variety of carrying options, making it extremely versatile.

On the downside, the Kobun's default clip feels a bit flimsy. But, this can be easily remedied by replacing it with a more durable option, like a Tek-Lok belt attachment, to enhance its overall performance.

Despite this minor issue, the Cold Steel Kobun is an excellent choice for anyone looking to add a reliable and potent personal defense tool to their collection. Its compact size and lightweight design make it a perfect everyday carry option, fitting snugly into a boot or hidden within a pack or gear setup.

In conclusion, the Cold Steel Kobun is a practical and tactical choice for anyone in need of a compact, yet highly effective, personal defense weapon. Its sleek design, reliable construction, and versatile sheath options make it a standout choice, even among Cold Steel's already impressive catalog of knives.

### [Durable Multi-Functional Lockback Knife](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=durable-multi-functional-lockback-knife)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=cold-steel-40at-click-n-cut-hunter-lockback-knife-1"><img alt="cold-steel-40at-click-n-cut-hunter-lockback-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cold-steel-40at-click-n-cut-hunter-lockback-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using Cold Steel's Click'N'Cut Slock Master Knife for a while now, and I can tell you it's been a game-changer. The three replaceable blades - a clip-point blade, a serrated blade, and a cutting blade - have made my hobby projects so much easier. I especially love the clip-point blade for its precision and the serrated blade for cutting through tougher materials. The thickness of the blades is quite impressive, giving me a sense of confidence while handling tough tasks.

However, there's one thing that could be improved - the handle. It looks a bit cheap and could use some upgrading in terms of design and material. I'm not a fan of the black Griv-Ex handle, but that's just my personal preference.

Another thing that I absolutely love about this knife is the Click'N'Cut mechanism. It's so easy to switch between blades and the Tri-Ad lock provides excellent strength across all tasks. Plus, the knife comes with a handy "Secure-Ex" sheath that securely holds everything, even the extra blades.

Despite being a lightweight 142 grams, the knife has a great balance and feel in my hand. It's definitely worth trading in your old hobby knife for this one. Overall, I'm quite happy with Cold Steel's Click'N'Cut Slock Master Knife, and I'd give it four out of five stars.

### [Spec Ops Retractable Utility Knife](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=spec-ops-retractable-utility-knife)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=spec-ops-retractable-blade-utility-knife-1"><img alt="spec-ops-retractable-blade-utility-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/spec-ops-retractable-blade-utility-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Spec Ops Retractable Blade Utility Knife, I can confidently say it has lived up to its promise of being an indispensable tool in my daily tasks. The shock-absorbing vented pistol grip indeed provides unmatched control and comfort, making cutting through various materials feel like a breeze. The thumb press gives me maximum cutting power, while the push-button mechanism for blade swapping ensures rapid reloading without any hassle.

One of my favorite features is the quick-release onboard storage that includes five blades. It's incredibly convenient to have everything within easy reach, especially when I'm on the go. Plus, the compatibility with SRS Retention Lanyards adds an extra layer of safety. The built-in slot designed for strap or string cutting is yet another great feature that I find extremely useful.

However, I must point out that the initial learning curve of handling this knife can be slightly steep due to the push-button blade retraction mechanism. It may take some time to get used to, but once you've mastered it, the smooth adjustment and quick cutting becomes second nature.

Overall, the Spec Ops Retractable Blade Utility Knife offers excellent value for money, especially considering its durability (100' drop-tested, armor-grade aluminum body) and thoughtful design features. This knife has truly become one of my go-to tools in both indoor and outdoor activities. Highly recommended!

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/spring-assist-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=spring-assist-knives&utm_term=spring-assist-knives-4"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Spring+Assist+Knives-4/public" alt="Spring Assist Knives-4"></a></div>

Spring Assist Knives refer to knives that utilize a spring mechanism to rapidly deploy their blades with just one hand. The blade can typically be locked into place without requiring continuous pressure from the user's thumb or hand.

### Are Spring Assist Knives legal in all states?

Spring Assist Knives are not universally legal in all states. Some states, such as California and New Jersey, have banned these types of knives along with automatic knives. Check your local laws and restrictions before purchasing.

### Do Spring Assist Knives offer better grip than traditional knives?

### How can I ensure the safety of my Spring Assist Knife?

- Always keep your knife in a safe and secure location when not in use. Consider using a sheath or knife block for added protection.

- Never carry your Spring Assist Knife in a manner that could cause it to accidentally deploy. Always ensure the blade is properly locked in place.

- Keep the knife away from children and other unauthorized users.
