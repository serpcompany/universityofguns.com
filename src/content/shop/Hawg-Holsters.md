The width of the belt loops also helped balance out the weight distribution of my gun, making it feel like it wasn't there at all.

The versatility is another great feature â€“ being able to switch between both leather belt loops and tuckable C-hooks makes this holster suitable for various situations or attire. Overall, the V-Hawk from Galco has been an excellent choice providing added comfort while maintaining a deep concealment profile - highly recommended!
