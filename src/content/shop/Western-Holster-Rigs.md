<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=this-new-level-ii-tactical-universal-drop-leg-holster-fits-for-over-100-most-fullcompact-size-pistol-1"><img alt="this-new-level-ii-tactical-universal-drop-leg-holster-fits-for-over-100-most-fullcompact-size-pistol-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/this-new-level-ii-tactical-universal-drop-leg-holster-fits-for-over-100-most-fullcompact-size-pistol-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently started using this product as part of my daily routine and I'm thrilled with its performance. The construction is sturdy and the fit is comfortable, making it perfect for all-day use. The compatibility with various pistol sizes is a significant advantage.

One feature that stood out to me was the universal gun holster capable of fitting most full & compact size pistols. It's convenient not having to worry about getting separate holsters for each handgun – one is enough! The dual nylon leg straps and widened drop belt strap provide added durability and support, making it an excellent choice for law enforcement or military personnel, as well as avid hunters.

The "quick connection device" connecting the holster to the platform is another highlight. With this feature, adjusting the holster to fit different size guns is a breeze – simply press two buttons on either side of the platform and your holster is unattached from the platform, ready for adjustments. This also makes cleaning much easier than other products I have tried in the past.

Another plus point is its ability to carry multiple magazines at once - with this one platform you could carry 1 gun and 4 mags simultaneously! The flexible silicon ergonomic arc design ensures that it stays snug on your leg no matter your body type – absolutely no movement around on my leg even during intense activities.

Overall, this police tactical drop leg holster has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort, versatility, and ease-of-use. Highly recommended for those who want a reliable product that won't let them down in any situation!

### [Right Hand Vaquero Western Holster Rig for Uberti](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=right-hand-vaquero-western-holster-rig-for-uberti)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=triple-k-western-style-holster-1"><img alt="triple-k-western-style-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/triple-k-western-style-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

If you own a Uberti revolver, then the Western Holster Rigs should be at the top of your list for a functional and stylish holster. The quality of the leather is high-grade and sturdy, providing a snug fit for my firearm. Its versatility allows it to accommodate a wide range of pistols, including Colt models and Remington revolvers. This makes it an excellent choice for those with multiple firearms or who plan on switching their carry gun in the future.

Breaking in this holster was surprisingly easy - out of the box, the leather was already supple, but shaping it around my gun after soaking in hot water achieved a perfect fit that permits smooth drawing and reholstering. The design promotes safety during use as well, with no exposed trigger guard reducing the chance of accidental discharge while carrying your pistol in this rig. Not only practical, but this holster also looks fantastic with its rich dark brown color complementing any outfit or uniform you may wear when using it for competitions or historical events.

Overall, if you're searching for a high-quality western-style holster that offers excellent value for money and can adjust to various pistols, this product from Cabela's is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=44-45-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-long-barrel-black-tooled-leather-old-west-1"><img alt="44-45-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-long-barrel-black-tooled-leather-old-west-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/44-45-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-long-barrel-black-tooled-leather-old-west-1/public"/></a></div>

The Western Revolver Holster and Belt is a high-quality product that offers both style and functionality for revolver enthusiasts. The thick leather construction and beautiful floral tooling make this holster and belt a durable yet visually appealing addition to any western attire.

One of the standout features is the adjustable trigger strap, which allows users to customize the fit of their revolvers in the holster, ensuring a secure hold throughout the day. Additionally, the matching leg tie strap provides added peace of mind against accidental drops or loss of grip while on-the-go.

Although there were some minor issues with an initial strong dye smell when initially receiving the product, this dissipated after airing out for a few days. However, sizing can be challenging as it took some patience before finding just the right measurements - so be sure to give yourself enough time if ordering online without being able to see or try it on firsthand.

Overall, these small inconveniences don't detract from what truly remains an excellent item: well-made with great attention to detail, perfect for anyone looking for authentic cowboy gear they can feel confident carrying their weapon safely yet stylishly too!

### [Chocolate Brown Western Holster and Belt Set for Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=chocolate-brown-western-holster-and-belt-set-for-revolvers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=38-357-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-chocolate-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1"><img alt="38-357-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-chocolate-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/38-357-cal-western-holster-and-belt-rh-draw-chocolate-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this western gun belt and holster in chocolate brown, and I must say that it has met all my expectations. The level of craftsmanship is impressive, with details like floral tooling on the belt and holster adding a touch of authenticity.

One feature that stands out is the adjustable buckle on the belt, allowing for a perfect fit around my waist and ensuring comfort even when worn for extended periods of time. Another aspect worth mentioning is how seamlessly the revolver fits into the holster - there's no worry about it falling out unexpectedly. Plus, having shell loops on the back of the belt adds convenience as ammunition can be carried at all times.

My slight criticism would be related to sizing; while following their sizing chart provides a close estimate, getting it custom-made might be ideal if your size falls between two markings. However, this is a minor point compared to overall product quality.

In summary, if you're in search of an authentic-looking western gun belt and holster rig that not only looks great but also offers practicality and safety when carrying your revolver – look no further than this one from Historical Emporium!

### [Two-Tone Tooled Leather Western Cross Draw Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=two-tone-tooled-leather-western-cross-draw-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=western-holster-rh-cross-draw-two-tone-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1"><img alt="western-holster-rh-cross-draw-two-tone-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/western-holster-rh-cross-draw-two-tone-brown-tooled-leather-old-west-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I recently got the chance to experience the Western Tooled Leather Cross Draw Revolver Holster made in Mexico. This premium quality leather holster fit my standard frame revolver perfectly, thanks to its adjustable features. The leather's authentic tooled design evoked the spirit of the 1800's Southwest and its fit and finish were excellent, making it an attractive piece that serves its function while looking great on display.

One feature I appreciated was the adjustable leather hammer loop that snugly secured my revolver, providing peace of mind while carrying. The holster also had an internal loop for attaching a belt on both sides, allowing for a cross draw carry option. It can accommodate double action revolvers from other manufacturers with equivalent frames to Smith & Wesson as well.

The attention to detail and craftsmanship stood out for me as exceptional; however, there were minor issues regarding fitting some larger barrel lengths accurately since it is sized mainly for a standard frame revolver with barrel lengths ranging between 4-6 inches. Additionally, their customer service team is always ready to help if you have questions about your revolver compatibility with this holster.

Overall, this Western Tooled Leather Cross Draw Revolver Holster is definitely worth considering if you are looking for a high-quality handmade product that offers durability and functionality while staying true to its western origins. With proper care and maintenance, this holster should last for years without losing its appeal or performance capabilities.

### [Level III Retention Duty Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P 9 with Red Dot Sight](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=level-iii-retention-duty-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-9-with-red-dot-sight)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=model-6360rds-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-9-w-light-6360rd-1"><img alt="model-6360rds-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-9-w-light-6360rd-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/model-6360rds-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-9-w-light-6360rd-1/public"/></a></div>

As a dedicated gun owner, I was excited to try out the 6360RDS holster designed for firearms with red dot sights. This model incorporates both the Self Locking System (SLS) and the Automatic Locking System (ALS), ensuring my weapon is securely locked in all directions while holstered. The thumb-activated release mechanism took some getting used to, but once mastered, it made drawing my weapon smooth and effortless. Plus, I could easily draw my firearm straight out of the holster without any twisting required - an excellent feature in terms of speed and efficiency.

The product specs were on point: duty application-specific, QLS 19/QLS 22 belt loop/slot snap width of 2. 25 inches, compatible with 9mm Luger cartridges, suitable for handguns and pistols, made from SafariLaminate material, and classified as a belt holster type with level III retention. After extensive use though there's a break-in period where the holster feels stiff and slow to draw from; however after several hundred practice draws it began to smooth out nicely without additional materials like silicone spray needed. The construction of plastic can sometimes make it harder for light to pass through when trying to draw using your non-gun hand only; however this didn’t hinder its overall performance or durability during testing!

Overall this product exceeded expectations by offering excellent security along with reliable quick access when needed most - something law enforcement officers will certainly appreciate! The double automatic lock mechanism provides added peace of mind by ensuring your weapon remains secure until you are ready to use it again. Though complex due its many moveable parts - once familiarized with its operation - using this holster becomes second nature making everyday carry much easier than ever before possible!

### [4-Way Concealment Leather Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=4-way-concealment-leather-gun-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/western-holster-rigs?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=western-holster-rigs&utm_term=4-way-concealment-belt-leather-holster-size-5-vintage-right-1"><img alt="4-way-concealment-belt-leather-holster-size-5-vintage-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/4-way-concealment-belt-leather-holster-size-5-vintage-right-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the 4-way concealment holster from 1791 Gunleather for my Sig P229 pistol, and I have been impressed with its quality and versatility. The leather is durable and soft, providing a comfortable fit against my body while carrying my firearm.

One of the standout features of this holster is its ability to be worn in four different positions: vertical cant, horizontal cant, cross-draw cant, and inside the waistband (IWB). This adaptability has allowed me to carry my pistol discreetly in various situations based on my needs. I've found that wearing it inside the waistband provides the most concealment while still offering quick access when needed. It does require a break-in period to ensure a secure fit for your specific firearm, but with regular use, the holster conforms to the shape of your gun.

I appreciate how well this holster retains its shape over time; even after numerous draws and re-holstering, it keeps its form and continues to provide a reliable grip on my pistol. Additionally, it has held up well against daily wear and tear - no tears or fraying even after months of use!

Overall, I highly recommend 1791 Gunleather's 4-way concealment holster to anyone looking for an adaptable carry solution at an affordable price point. Its versatility makes it ideal for everyday carry or more specific situations where you may need quick access to your firearm without drawing attention to yourself.

To keep your leather holster in good condition, clean it with a soft cloth and leather cleaner, then apply leather conditioner to maintain flexibility and suppleness.
