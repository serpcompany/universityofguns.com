### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/breaching-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/breaching-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Hybrid Leather & Kydex Holster for Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/breaching-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

Ah, my Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat. This is not just another holster; it's a daily companion that's been with me through thick and thin. The blend of Kydex's precise retention and leather's comfort is a match made in heaven. No more break-in time, just smooth and secure draw and re-holster.

One thing I particularly love about this holster is its versatility. Whether I'm carrying it AIWB, IWB, or OWB, it never fails to adapt. The adjustable cant allows me to position it just right for a comfortable draw, and the ambidextrous design lets both lefties and righties carry in their preferred hand positioning.

As a bonus, this holster is handmade to perfection at MFT facilities right here in the USA. Talk about a labor of love!

However, it does have its quirks. I've noticed that the screws tend to loosen up more frequently than I'd like, causing occasional discomfort. Also, be prepared for some visible wear over time, but then again, isn't that part of the journey with any EDC tool?

All in all, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat has been a solid addition to my EDC arsenal. It offers a perfect blend of comfort, versatility, and adjustability that makes it stand out among other holsters.

The high-quality materials used in its construction are durable and make me feel confident in its long-term use.

In terms of comfort, the VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk has been a dream. Its slim design makes it incredibly comfortable to wear all day without sacrificing concealment. I appreciate how the adjustable cant and tension allow me to customize the fit and draw speed to my preference.

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a few minor cons. The retention system can be a bit stiff initially, but it loosens up over time. Additionally, while the holster is suitable for right-handed users, left-handed shooters might not find it as practical.

All in all, I would highly recommend the DeSantis VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable holster for their Springfield Armory Hellcat. Its unique design and solid retention make it a top choice in the market.

Notably, it's designed with optics compatibility, making it a versatile option for gun enthusiasts across the board.

I personally find the holster incredibly comfortable to wear and highly efficient in its purpose of concealed carry. Its minimalistic design ensures it seamlessly disappears under clothing. However, one minor inconvenience I've encountered is that it occasionally requires a tighter squeeze to achieve a smooth draw.

Overall, the Crucial Concealment IWB FN has been nothing short of a reliable companion in my daily life. Its adjustable features are definitely worth mentioning, as they offer a tailored fit and ease of use.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/breaching-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-photon-springfield-hellcat-holster-in-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black, and it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who appreciates both modularity and practicality, this holster has truly surpassed my expectations.

First off, the photon is incredibly versatile. It can be easily converted from an OWB (Outside the Waistband) to an IWB (Inside the Waistband) configuration, making it perfect for different situations or preferences. Plus, it's designed with appendix carry in mind, which I find extremely comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features of this holster is its compatibility with various optics, including the SRO. This was a huge plus for me, as I didn't have to worry about investing in another holster just to accommodate my sights.

However, no product is perfect. Some users may find the holster's bulkiness to be a bit cumbersome, and attaching it to your belt can be tricky at first due to the unique design of the clip and claw combo.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon Springfield Hellcat Holster in Black. It's an excellent choice for those looking for versatility and comfort in their EDC (Everyday Carry) holster.

### [Versacarry Distressed Brown OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/breaching-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

Finding the perfect holster can be a daunting task, but the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made it an enjoyable experience for me. As someone who carries a full-sized 1911, I was initially skeptical about how concealable it would be. However, the forward cant design ensures the gun stays tight against my body, while the raised protective backing provides both comfort and protection.

One of the things that stood out for me was the unique leather material; made from premium water buffalo leather, it's not only durable but also breaks in incredibly fast. I'm also thrilled with the right-handed draw feature which suits my dominance perfectly. The fact that it's handcrafted in the USA and backed by a lifetime warranty just adds more value to this already amazing product.

However, one minor con is that there could be more size options to cater to various types of guns. But with the available sizes fitting most compact, full-sized, and subcompact handguns, it is still a versatile choice for many.

All in all, the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made concealed carry comfortable and secure for me. It's truly a best buy for the money! "
