### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barsony-shoulder-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=barsony-shoulder-holsters&utm_term=blade-tech-classic-owb-holster-for-wilson-combat-92g-brigadier-tactical)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barsony-shoulder-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=barsony-shoulder-holsters&utm_term=wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1"><img alt="wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for the Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical, and it has quickly become one of my favorites. The adjustable retention screws are a standout feature that I appreciate, as they allow me to fine-tune the fit of my firearm so it feels just right. Additionally, I love how IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design makes this holster perfect for competition, while the positive lock trigger guard ensures that my firearm stays securely stored at all times.

The compatibility with optics is another great feature that makes this holster unique. It's also impressive to see that Blade Tech crafts these holsters with precision in the USA using high-strength Boltaron material, which speaks volumes about their durability and reliability. Plus, their lifetime guarantee gives me extra peace of mind when using this product out in the field.

However, there are a couple of things I wish could be improved upon: Firstly, having wider belt loop options would make this holster more versatile in terms of carry set up. Secondly, some users have reported issues with adjusting screws getting stuck or not fitting properly when switching out attachments - something that could potentially be improved upon by Blade Tech in future iterations of their product lineup! But overall these drawbacks are minor compared to all the awesome features packed into this exceptional holster; definitely worth considering if you're serious about competitive shooting or simply want an excellent OWB option for everyday carry!

### [ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster for Right-Hand Draw](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barsony-shoulder-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=barsony-shoulder-holsters&utm_term=comforttac-ultimate-belly-band-holster-for-right-hand-draw)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barsony-shoulder-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=barsony-shoulder-holsters&utm_term=comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-regular-black-1"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-regular-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-regular-black-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster for several weeks, I have found it to be a great concealed carry option. The design allows for smooth and fast draws while keeping your firearm securely in place. One of the notable features is its versatility; it comes in three sizes that cater to different body types, and can be worn in various positions according to personal preferences. The built-in pocket is also handy, providing extra space to carry magazines or small essentials like keys or ID cards.

The breathable neoprene band is comfortable to wear even during hot days, which is a big plus for warm climate dwellers. However, larger weapons can make the holster uncomfortable as they press against the body more noticeably than smaller ones do. Also, this holster doesn't offer much storage space besides an extra magazine or two, so if you need additional storage capacity, this might not be the best choice for you.

In conclusion, I am pleased with my experience using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster due to its easy accessibility and discretion combined with convenience. It may have some minor downsides but overall it's a solid product worth trying out!

The quality leather and exceptional craftsmanship provide a snug and secure fit for my firearm, making it easy to forget I'm even carrying a full-size handgun. The intricate design, including the metal attachment rings and ergonomic shape, ensures that I have both functionality and comfort all day long.

Although the break-in period for the leather can take some time, I found that it resulted in an even better fitting holster that molded perfectly to my body shape.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/barsony-shoulder-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=barsony-shoulder-holsters&utm_term=comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-xl-nude-deep-concealment-edition-1"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-xl-nude-deep-concealment-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-xl-nude-deep-concealment-edition-1/public"/></a></div>

As someone who has had the opportunity to personally test and evaluate the ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster, I can confidently state that it is an impressive option for concealed carry. One of the most notable features is its versatility, allowing it to be worn in a variety of positions suitable for different body types and clothing choices. The elastic band adjusts comfortably to any body size, making it an excellent choice for various users.

One unique aspect of this holster is its ability to accommodate deeper carrying positions than a typical kydex AIWB holster. This feature allows me to carry AIWB without difficulty, despite having a slightly larger belly than in my younger years. The perforated holes promote less sweating as well, which has been a significant issue with other products in hotter temperatures.

In terms of drawbacks, some users have expressed concerns about the snap on the retention strap popping open during movement; however, this was not an issue during my testing period. Minor suggestions include exploring possibilities for improving security features or incorporating a built-in hard trigger guard, but these were not major concerns while using the product daily over several weeks.

Overall, if you are looking for an adaptable and comfortable concealment option that won't break your budget - look no further than the ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster. With features like its extra large size supporting up to a 54" belly circumference, right-hand draw capability, quickdraw access with its retention strap and deep concealment buckle along with fitting various gun sizes and being versatile enough to be worn in most positions makes it stand out from competitors like Keeper Holsters or Barsony Shoulder Holsters on so many levels!

After using the Gun & Flower Shoulder Holster for a few months, I can confidently say that it's one of the best shoulder holsters available in the market. Made from top-notch full-grain Italian leather, this holster is incredibly durable. It fits my firearms perfectly and provides a secure carry while being comfortable enough to wear all day.

One feature that I found particularly impressive is its universal gun holster design, capable of fitting more than 1600 different types of firearms. This versatility means that even if you own multiple pistols, this one holster can accommodate them all.

The mag pouch on the opposite side is designed with adjustable brass snap and washer, making it size-flexible to hold double or single stack snugly without any issues. It's also easy to use with velcro and brass snap allowing you to detach and attach the holster to your belt quickly, along with tie-down straps that keep everything securely in place while providing an impressive fast draw when needed.

Overall, I highly recommend the Gun & Flower Shoulder Holster for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and versatile shoulder holster for concealed carry purposes. However, there are some areas where it could be improved â€“ like better instructions in case users aren't familiar with such products as well as an option for left-handed shooters too; but despite these minor concerns the Gun & Flower Shoulder Holster is still a great choice overall!
