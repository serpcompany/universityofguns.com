### [Heavy Paper Rifle Targets for Practice and Competition, 100-Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=uspsa-targets&utm_term=heavy-paper-rifle-targets-for-practice-and-competition-100-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=uspsa-targets&utm_term=national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1"><img alt="national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-target-international-bench-rest-shooters-target-ibs-100-yd-hunter-rifle-paper-pack-of-100-s-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using these heavy paper targets for a while now, and they have become my go-to choice for both practice and competitions. One of the standout features of this product is its high-quality paper, which allows for clear visibility of bullet holes even when using plugs. The bright white center X ring stands out against the rest of the target, making aiming and overall accuracy much easier.

Another great aspect about these targets is their versatility - they work just as well at 59 yards as they do at 100 yards, and are thick enough to cover up previous shots without tearing or shattering around the holes. They are also not too fragile, allowing them to be stapled onto backers without getting damaged. Plus, with several bullseyes on one sheet, you can easily compare different loads during load development sessions.

While I have found this product to be fantastic overall, there is always room for improvement. One area where it could be better is in durability - after extensive use in competitions or practice sessions, the targets may start to show wear and tear more quickly than some other brands. However, despite this minor drawback, these heavy paper targets have definitely enhanced my shooting experience and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable target option!

### [Durable Bouncing Hot Box Target for Multiple Calibers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=uspsa-targets&utm_term=durable-bouncing-hot-box-target-for-multiple-calibers)

The Target model is a fantastic choice for shooting enthusiasts looking for a reliable and durable target. After using it in my daily practice sessions, I can attest to its impressive capacity of withstanding up to 1000 rounds. The ability of the target to self-heal upon impact ensures that you can keep practicing without having to constantly replace the target.

One of the greatest features of this product is how each shot produces a unique experience, as the target randomly bounces, rolls and moves around. This unpredictability keeps things exciting and prevents any dull moments during your shooting sessions. Additionally, the target is compatible with different calibers such as. 22 to. 50 cal rifles, pistols and shotguns, making it versatile for various firearms.

Although I did not encounter any major issues during my time with this product, one minor drawback could be that it can get quite addicting trying to hit the moving target! However, overall this target guarantees an enjoyable experience for all levels of firearm enthusiasts - whether practicing or competing - it'll have you coming back for more thrilling rounds every time!

The fluorescent green and pink halo surrounding the point of impact makes spotting shots effortless from a distance. I love how easy it is to stick these targets to any surface and appreciate that they're printed on heavy stock paper, which extends their lifespan.

As a dedicated shooter, I recently purchased the AC Zone Toso steel target from Shooting Targets 7. This 12" x 24" target is made using yellow zinc-plated USA laser-cut AR500 steel, perfectly designed for static use. It features a center hole for quick and easy mounting on a 1/2” carriage bolt, making it incredibly convenient to set up and take down.
