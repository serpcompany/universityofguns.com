The IDPA and USPSA legal optic ready speed cut design allows for efficient draws and target acquisition in competition, making it stand out from other holsters on the market. While I did come across one minor issue with attaching some accessories due to smaller holes in comparison with Tek-Lok attachment, this could be easily remedied by providing different sized screw options or enlarging those holes slightly.

Despite this small hiccup, I would still highly recommend this holster to anyone looking for a well-built and reliable product that doesn't break the bank. Its modular mounting holes and adjustable retention screws offer customizability while ensuring your firearm remains secure throughout the day - all backed by a lifetime guarantee.
