### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=automobile-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=automobile-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Hybrid Leather & Kydex Holster for Hellcat](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=automobile-gun-holsters&utm_term=hybrid-leather-kydex-holster-for-hellcat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automobile-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=automobile-gun-holsters&utm_term=mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-1/public"/></a></div>

Ah, my Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat. This is not just another holster; it's a daily companion that's been with me through thick and thin. The blend of Kydex's precise retention and leather's comfort is a match made in heaven. No more break-in time, just smooth and secure draw and re-holster.

One thing I particularly love about this holster is its versatility. Whether I'm carrying it AIWB, IWB, or OWB, it never fails to adapt. The adjustable cant allows me to position it just right for a comfortable draw, and the ambidextrous design lets both lefties and righties carry in their preferred hand positioning.

As a bonus, this holster is handmade to perfection at MFT facilities right here in the USA. Talk about a labor of love!

However, it does have its quirks. I've noticed that the screws tend to loosen up more frequently than I'd like, causing occasional discomfort. Also, be prepared for some visible wear over time, but then again, isn't that part of the journey with any EDC tool?

All in all, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat has been a solid addition to my EDC arsenal. It offers a perfect blend of comfort, versatility, and adjustability that makes it stand out among other holsters.
