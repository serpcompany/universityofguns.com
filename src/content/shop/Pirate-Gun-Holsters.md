<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hilason-western-leather-shoulder-rig-gun-holster-44-45-caliber-black-costume-holster-cowboy-gun-hols-1/public"/></a></div>

In my quest for the perfect western-style leather shoulder rig gun holster, I came across the Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster 44/45 Caliber Black. Now a devoted fan, I'm excited to share my experience with this must-have accessory.

To begin with, the intricate hand tooling and hand-carved traditional designs on this holster are nothing short of exceptional. The level of craftsmanship is evident in every detail, from the unbreakable metal core casing to the adjustable hammer loop.

One of my favorite features is the leather leg tie, which not only enhances durability but also adds an extra layer of comfort. The leg flap behind the holster is yet another practical touch that sets this product apart from others.

As for the gun belt itself, it's designed to hold about 16-52 rounds of ammo, making it incredibly versatile and suitable for various needs. The full-grain American Cowhide leather harness ensures durability and longevity, while the consistent vegetable drum dye coloring adds a touch of sophistication.

Finding the right size can be a challenge, but ordering 4 to 6 inches larger than your pants size should do the trick. The belt has about 5 holes all an inch apart, so you can adjust it as needed for a comfortable fit.

In terms of barrel length compatibility, this holster is designed to fit most barrel lengths ranging from 4 to 8 inches, making it an excellent choice for a wide variety of firearms.

Overall, I can't recommend the Hilason Western Leather Shoulder Rig Gun Holster enough. The combination of expert craftsmanship, practical features, and stylish design make it the ultimate accessory for any western gun enthusiast.

### [Advanced Pocket Holster for Sig P365 and P365 XL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-super-fly-pocket-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster for a while now, and I can't recommend it enough. The exclusive sticky rubberized fabric is incredible - it really grips onto your pocket and ensures your gun stays in place. Plus, the removable and reversible outer flap is a nice touch for further concealment.

One feature that stood out for me was the low-friction draw. The slick pack cloth on the inside makes drawing your weapon a breeze, even in high-pressure situations. The added polymer reinforcement in strategic places also adds to the overall durability of the holster.

Another highlight is the design that accommodates both back and front pocket carry. This versatility is great for those who prefer different positions depending on the day or situation.

However, there are a few minor cons. Some users have reported issues with fitting the holster in their pockets, but this might vary based on individual pocket sizes or the type of clothing worn. Overall, the DeSantis Super Fly Pocket Holster is a reliable, high-quality option for those looking for a comfortable and concealed pocket holster.

### [S&W M&P Shield Speed Scabbard Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

As an avid user of the DeSantis Speed Scabbard Holster, I can confidently say it has been my go-to choice for concealed carry purposes. The holster's unique design fits perfectly with my S&W M&P Shield, providing a snug fit that ensures optimal retention and swift drawing when needed. Its precision molding and adjustable tension screw device ensure that my firearm stays securely in place yet quickly accessible at all times.

One of the standout features of this holster is its ability to remain virtually non-detectable even under just a loose-fitting shirt. This provides an extra layer of concealment, which is a must for those who prioritize discretion. Its adjustable detent system allows me to fine-tune the fit according to my preference, making it incredibly versatile and customizable.

However, there were some minor drawbacks too. Some users mention that the holster could be slightly long for certain models, leading to reduced concealment efficiency. Additionally, it's recommended to "stretch" the holster slightly before use to make inserting your firearm smoother and easier.

In conclusion, the DeSantis Speed Scabbard Holster is a reliable and efficient choice for anyone seeking a high-quality holster for concealed carry purposes. Its comfortable fit, outstanding retention, and customizable adjustments make it an attractive option in the market. Despite a few minor issues, it stands out as a top-notch product worth considering.

### [Galco Combat Master Belt Holster for S&W M&P](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-cm472b-combat-master-belt-holster-sw-mp-right-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-cm472b-combat-master-belt-holster-sw-mp-right-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer. Crafted from premium saddle leather, this holster boasts double-stitched seams and hand-molded fit, making it a high-quality piece of equipment. The open-top design enables quick access to your weapon, which is crucial in high-pressure situations. And let me tell you, the detailed molding ensures that your gun stays securely in place.

One of the standout features of this holster is its butt-forward cant. I was initially skeptical about how well it would conceal larger firearms, but I've been pleasantly surprised. With a dark t-shirt and the right positioning at 4 o'clock, it's practically invisible.

However, I have experienced one minor drawback. The holster tends to loosen up a bit after some use, but this can be easily fixed by adding a retention strap. Overall, the Galco Combat Master Belt Holster has been an excellent addition to my everyday carry, offering exceptional quality, comfort, and concealment.

### [Faux Leather Pirate Weapon Belt with Gun and Sword Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pirate-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="leather-like-pirate-sword-gun-holder-belt-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leather-like-pirate-sword-gun-holder-belt-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently decked myself out in a pirate costume and, being the swashbuckler that I am, used the Leather Like Pirate Sword & Gun Holder Belt to keep my weapons at the ready. The belt felt comfortable enough around my waist, and the adjustable straps meant I could tighten it for that snug fit typical of pirate garb. The faux leather was a nice touch, adding authenticity to my outfit without causing any genuine damage to any real leather items.

The real highlight, though, was the functional metal buckle. It brought home the pirate aesthetic, giving my ensemble a certain rugged charm that made me feel like I was boarding a ship, ready to hoist the Jolly Roger! Plus, with a few loop holsters, I could swing my cutlass or brandish my flintlock pistols with ease, fully embracing my inner Jack Sparrow.

There were, however, a few minor drawbacks. As faux leather, it did lack the rich feel of genuine leatherâ€”it felt just a bit too plasticine for my taste. And while the large size of the holsters was perfect for all my swashbuckling weapons, it might be a bit too bulky for a more casual costume wearer.

In conclusion, if you're looking to amp up your pirate costume, the Leather Like Pirate Sword & Gun Holder Belt is a worthy addition. With its adjustable straps, functional metal buckle, and authentic pirate appearance, it's sure to bring your costume game to the high seas!
