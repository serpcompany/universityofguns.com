<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. After using it for several months, I have noticed some positive aspects as well as a few areas where it could improve.

One great feature of this gun safe is the key-coded cylinder lock and 4-way door locking, providing me with a sense of security when I'm away from my guns. The molded barrel rests and foam-padded bottom also help protect my antique firearms from any dings or scratches. These features make the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe stand out in terms of protection for your weapons.

However, there are a couple of issues that I have encountered during use. The instructions provided were low in quality, making assembly a bit challenging. Additionally, some users have reported durability issues with certain parts such as hinges and door latches, which can cause concern when relying on this product to protect your valuables over time.

Overall, the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe does provide basic protection for your firearms with its sturdy structure and multiple locks. However, if you're looking for something more heavy-duty or long lasting in terms of construction quality, this might not be the ideal option for you.

### [RFID Gun Safe with Digital Clock and USB Charging Ports](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=rfid-gun-safe-with-digital-clock-and-usb-charging-ports)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard as my go-to bedside firearm safe for several months now, and it has consistently impressed me. The RFID technology is incredibly convenient and provides quick and hands-free access to my handgun, even in low light conditions. I really appreciate the stealthy operation of the spring-assisted drawer, which is super quiet when opened during nighttime use.

The build quality is excellent, with a heavy-duty exterior housing that meets strict industry standards for firearm storage. The hardened interior locking lugs add an extra layer of protection and peace of mind. Additionally, I love the unique features like the digital clock display and USB charging ports for electronic devices - these not only make life easier but also add to the overall value of this safe.

There are minor drawbacks to consider, such as some users reporting accuracy issues with the clock, but this hasn't been a significant concern in my experience. Programming multiple RFID tags may be time-consuming initially, but it ultimately enhances convenience and flexibility when accessing the safe.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and secure bedside gun safe with innovative hands-free technology and added functionality like charging ports and an included security cable. With its strong construction and thoughtful design features, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard truly stands out among its competitors in terms of both style and substance.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick-1"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1/public"/></a></div>

Having tested this high-capacity gun safe, I can confirm it's a great option for securing firearms at home. The two separate layers provide ample storage space, ideal for sharing with family members without compromising privacy. The biometric fingerprint lock adds extra security and peace of mind. Setting up the safe is quick and easy, plus it can store up to 20 fingerprint scans - impressive!

The solid steel construction and smooth anti-scratch finish are top-notch. However, some users reported that after setting both compartments' codes and fingerprints, the top compartment may no longer open using those methods - requiring a key instead. Despite this issue reported by some customers, the majority seem satisfied with their purchase – well constructed and roomy enough for multiple firearms or valuables storage.

In summary, this high-capacity gun safe offers excellent security features for protecting your firearms at home. Keep in mind its few quirks before making your decision. \xa0

The 1-Gun Biometric Gun Safe with Interior Lighting by SentrySafe is a compact and elegant solution for your home defense needs. The biometric fingerprint scanner allows for quick access to your firearm, while the gas strut ensures that the door opens quietly and effortlessly. The interior lighting is a useful feature that enables easy retrieval of your weapon in low-light conditions.

This gun safe also offers backup entry options through a digital keypad and override key, providing added security. However, some users have reported inconsistencies in the biometric sensor's performance, which may not be reliable in emergency situations. Additionally, there have been complaints about rechargeable batteries not working with this product, which can be inconvenient for those who prefer using them over alkaline batteries.

Despite these minor setbacks, overall I found this gun safe to be sturdy and well-made, offering advanced protection for my home defense needs. With dimensions of 12. 1 in W x 9. 9 in D x 3. 2 in H (interior: 9. 7 in W x 6. 7 in D x 2. 2 in H) and weighing only 12 pounds, it is easy to install and doesn't take up much space.

### [Cannon 48 Long Gun + 6 Handgun Safe with E-Lock and 45 Minute Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-safe-with-e-lock-and-45-minute-fire-rating)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon TS5934 Gun Safe and have been using it for the past month. Assembly was a bit challenging, so I enlisted some help due to its weight. The size is perfect for my storage needs, as it accommodates 48 long guns and 6 handguns comfortably. The door organization is a nice touch, providing ample space for smaller items. The carpeted interior with black leatherette trim ensures that my valuables are protected from scratches and damage.

The electronic lock and keypad work seamlessly, giving me peace of mind about accessing my safe's content when needed. However, I have concerns about the quality of some components such as the plastic shelf retainer clips which seem flimsy and could potentially break easily over time. Additionally, while the safe is fire-rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, there isn't enough information available on its fire resistance capabilities to give me complete confidence in its ability to protect my belongings in case of a fire.

Overall, this product meets most of my expectations in terms of securing my firearms and other valuable items. Despite minor concerns about component quality and fire resistance information, it serves its purpose well in keeping my possessions safe from potential threats such as thieves or fires.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet, and I must say, I'm quite impressed by its design and features. This compact cabinet is perfect for securing my long guns, and it definitely adds a sense of security to my home.

One of the standout features of this cabinet is its three-point locking system. It provides that extra layer of security that I was looking for. Additionally, the high-quality black powder-coated paint gives it a sleek and attractive finish.

Another aspect that I really like about this product is its soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor. This ensures that my firearms stay safe and intact, even during those tumultuous times when you might need to quickly retrieve them.

One downside to this cabinet, however, is its assembly. It comes fully assembled, which is a great feature for convenience, but it's not the sturdiest. There have been a few instances where the seams have come undone, causing some concern about the overall durability of the cabinet.

Despite this minor issue, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet has been a great addition to my home. It provides peace of mind and ensures that my firearms are kept in a secure and organized space.

### [Stylish V-Line Tactical Weapons Locker XD](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=stylish-v-line-tactical-weapons-locker-xd)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=v-line-tactical-weapons-locker-xd-1"><img alt="v-line-tactical-weapons-locker-xd-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/v-line-tactical-weapons-locker-xd-1/public"/></a></div>

As a firearms enthusiast, I've been using the V-Line Tactical Weapons Locker XD for quite some time now. I have to say, it's one of the best investments I've made. The upgrade they made from the non-tactical model is exceptional, especially the Molle Panel on the lid - it comes in handy for mounting holsters and other accessories.

The first thing that caught my eye was the robust construction - made of 14ga steel lid and a 16ga steel body, it's solid as a rock. Couple that with the heavy-duty lock cover and Simplex mechanical lock, securing my firearms became a matter of simply locking it up. No worries about dead batteries or jamming like with electronic locks!

The padded bottom and quick-release straps ensure my firearms and gear remain safe and secure during transportation. The locker also fits perfectly between wheel wells in most large vehicles, making it easy to transport my belongings wherever I go.

One con I noticed is the weight of the locker - at 55 lbs. , it's a bit cumbersome to lift by myself. However, considering its size and robustness, I believe it's a small price to pay.

All in all, the V-Line Tactical Weapons Locker XD is an excellent choice for anyone looking to secure their firearms, particularly for Law Enforcement professionals, security personnel, and public safety officials who often find themselves on the go.

### [Under Bed Quick Access Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/quick-access-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=quick-access-gun-safes&utm_term=under-bed-quick-access-gun-safe)

As a reviewer who's been using the American Security UBS648 Unter Bed Gun Safe, I must say it has added a new level of convenience and security to my home. This replacement for the DV652 model boasts a sleek, under-the-bed design, making it a perfect spot for storing my home-defense weapon.

The backlit ESL5LP digital lock stands out as one of the key features. Even in the dark, the numbers on the keypad are clearly visible, ensuring quick and efficient access when needed. Moreover, I appreciate the silent stealth mode option, which quietly opens the safe without alerting anyone nearby.

The foam-padded slide-out gun tray is another highlight. It's not only comfortable on my hands but also protects my firearms from scratches and damage. Additionally, it's roomy enough to hold a couple of other personal items alongside my guns.

However, the one drawback I've noticed is the requirement of a 6-digit code, which coupled with a knob turn, makes the unlocking process a teeny bit slower than I would prefer. Nonetheless, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the overall functionality and quality of the safe.

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a safe, reliable, and quick-access solution for your home-defense weapon, look no further than the American Security UBS648 Under Bed Gun Safe. It's not just secure, but also easy to use and perfectly sized for most beds. It's definitely worth considering for your home security needs.

Choose a safe with a locking mechanism that meets your security requirements and intended use.
