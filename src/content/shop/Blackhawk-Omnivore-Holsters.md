I recently purchased the Blackhawk Serpa CQC IWB Holsters for my FN FNS-9 firearm, and I have to say, it's quickly become one of my favorite concealment tools. The holster is incredibly well-made and securely holds my gun in place, giving me the confidence to carry it with ease.

The Blackhawk SERPA Sportster is an excellent holster for those seeking secure and easy access to their firearm. I have been using it with my Sig P220/P226/P228/P229 and have been impressed with its performance. The retention system ensures the weapon stays secure until you're ready to draw it, all while keeping your trigger finger in a perfect position. The holster's automatic lock mechanism makes it safe and secure, disengaging only when pressure is applied with your finger just above the trigger guard.

One of the standout features of this holster is its durability, made from high-quality materials for longevity under heavy use conditions. Additionally, the comfort level while wearing it is quite impressive - you barely even notice it's there! However, some users may need practice drawing with their index finger placed along the side initially, as this may be unfamiliar coming from other types of holsters. And while this model works great for open carry, those prioritizing concealed carry may find its bulkier size could result in print showing through clothing items.

Overall, if you are looking for a reliable and well-built holster that keeps your firearm safe yet readily accessible, the Blackhawk SERPA Sportster is worth considering. Its excellent performance combined with top-notch build quality make it a solid investment for anyone in need of dependable gear like myself.
