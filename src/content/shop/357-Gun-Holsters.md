### [Right Hand Thumb Break Scabbard Holster for S&W M&P Shield 9/40](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=357-gun-holsters&utm_term=right-hand-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-for-sw-mp-shield-940)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=357-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41"><img alt="desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-rh-thumb-break-scabbard-holster-sw-mp-shield-9-41/public"/></a></div>

The Desantis Thumb Break Scabbard belt holster has truly surpassed my expectations and proven to be an excellent option for concealed carry. The high-quality, thick leather is not only comfortable, but also securely holds my S&W model M&P Shield 9/40. It might take a little bit of time to break in the leather, but once it's molded perfectly to your body shape, you'll be glad you stuck with it.

What I appreciate most about this holster is its customizable carry options through its three belt slots (1 and 3/4 inches wide). This allows me to adjust the positioning of my firearm on my waistline as I see fit, making it easier to keep hidden under clothing without worrying about printing or shifting. The thumb break and precise molding work together with a tension device for added security while still allowing for a fast draw when needed.

In terms of comfort and concealability, this holster rides high on your waistline at the optimum angle - not too low or too high - which aids in both aspects. And with the firearm being presented at an optimum draw angle as well, accessing it quickly has become second nature to me over time. Overall, this product really does deliver what it promises: reliable yet comfortable concealed carry with easy accessibility when needed most!

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is my go-to accessory for my 1911 5" Government. This modular system is perfect for those who like to switch things up and try different carry positions throughout the day. With just a few quick adjustments, I can easily transform the ShapeShift from an IWB holster for casual outings to an OWB paddle holster for more active pursuits.

However, I did encounter some issues with the bulkiness of the holster, especially when using the OWB setup. It's clear that this product is designed with professionals like security personnel or police officers in mind. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and seems a bit wobbly when engaged.

On the positive side, though, the Alien Gear ShapeShift is made in the USA, which is a strong selling point for those who prefer American-made products. And let's not forget the bonus Holster Mount that comes with the Core Carry Pack – it's incredibly versatile and makes it easy to secure my ShapeShift to a variety of surfaces.

In conclusion, while the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack offers a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying positions, it may not be the most comfortable or practical option for everyone. If you're open to trying out various carrying styles and are okay with a slightly bulky design, this product might be worth considering. But if you prioritize comfort and convenience above all else, it might be best to keep looking.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=357-gun-holsters&utm_term=alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 5" Government, and let me tell you, it's been quite an experience. I've always been a fan of products made in the USA, so that was a big plus for me. What really impressed me was how easily I could transform this holster into different carrying positions: IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. It's like having four holsters in one!

The inclusion of the Holster Mount is a game-changer as well. It allows me to attach my ShapeShift to various surfaces in no time. However, there are a couple of cons to this otherwise impressive product. The first would be the bulkiness, especially when using the OWB setup. I find it too cumbersome for everyday carry, especially for those who aren't in a profession that requires it.

Another issue some users might face is the thumb release on the holster. It seems a bit wobbly and hard to push down when you need to use it. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still think the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is a solid choice for those looking for a versatile and modular holster for their 1911 5" Government.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=357-gun-holsters&utm_term=uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-kodra-sidekick-holster-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I remember the day I first got my hands on this Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Sidekick Holster. It was a hot summer day, and I was looking for a holster that could handle both the heat and the wear and tear of daily use. As soon as I slipped it on, I knew I had found something special.

This holster is not only durable and tough but also features a patented Kodra laminate with a padded, waterproof interior. This kept my firearm snug and secure, no matter how active I got throughout the day. Plus, the spring steel belt clip is powder-coated for corrosion resistance, ensuring that this holster will last me a lifetime.

One of the standout features for me is the reversible belt clip. This means I can wear it outside of my pants or opt for a more discreet inside-the-waistband carry. The non-stretch hook & loop retention strap and molded thumb break provide added security, making sure my firearm stays firmly in place no matter what.

However, there have been some minor issues. The strap, although sturdy, doesn't seem to be repairable, so if it were to break, I would need to replace the entire holster. Additionally, it didn't fit my Walther P99 as advertised, which disappointed me.

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Sidekick Holster. It's comfortable, reliable, and versatile, making it a perfect choice for both on- and off-duty situations.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/357-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=357-gun-holsters&utm_term=triple-k-211-easy-out-holster-right-hand-leather-black-1"><img alt="triple-k-211-easy-out-holster-right-hand-leather-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/triple-k-211-easy-out-holster-right-hand-leather-black-1/public"/></a></div>

For the average gun enthusiast, a reliable and comfortable concealed carry holster is a must-have. That's where the Triple K 211 Easy Out Holster comes in. Right from the unboxing, I appreciated the adjustable tension screw, which allows me to fine-tune the grip to my liking.

This holster is made of top-grain cowhide, known for its durability and resistance to wear and tear. I could immediately feel the difference in quality compared to cheaper options on the market. The craftsmanship is also noteworthy - the stitching and finishing details are of high quality.

Fitment was another area where this product shined. It comfortably fits most medium- to large-frame semiautomatics and small to medium revolvers with up to a 4 barrel length, accommodate belts up to 1-3/4 wide. However, if you're left-handed like me, be prepared to search elsewhere unless you're willing to use it awkwardly with your non-dominant hand.

One minor drawback is the initial breaking-in period. The first few uses felt a bit stiff, but after some wear, it softened up nicely and became more comfortable.

All in all, the Triple K 211 Easy Out Holster is a solid choice for those looking for a well-built and functional concealed carry holster. The adjustable tension screw, high-quality leather, and versatile fit make it a great addition to any gun owner's collection. Just be prepared to do a bit of breaking in!
