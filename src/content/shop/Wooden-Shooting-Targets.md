This versatile target post is perfect for practicing shooting with rimfire rifles and handguns, whether in the open field, at an outdoor range, or in the backyard.

One thing that stands out about this target post is its ease of use. The target paddles move from side to side, ensuring non-stop action and saving me the trouble of resetting them manually. Plus, the post is easy to install – just insert it into the ground for enhanced safety and stability.
