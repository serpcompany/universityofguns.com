After using the Sig P365 XL IWB Holster for several weeks, my experience has been a combination of positive and negative aspects. The lightweight design and practicality for concealed carry are notable features, offering a great overall option for those prioritizing these factors.

It does offer solid concealment at an affordable price point compared to other brands in the market.
