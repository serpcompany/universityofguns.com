### [Economy B27E Orange Silhouette Cut Off Targets (100 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="action-tgt-b27e-100pk-orange-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-tgt-b27e-100pk-orange-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to use the Orange Silhouette Cut Off Below Ring 7 target from Action Target, and I was pleasantly surprised at its quality. The bright orange color and distinct silhouette shape made it easy to aim at from a distance, which is essential for my shooting practice.

While labeled as an economy model, this target has held up well through multiple uses without tearing or falling apart. The paper quality is robust enough for continuous use, and the silhouette cut-off feature is particularly useful for law enforcement training or 3-gun competitions. It adds realism to my practice sessions without breaking the bank.

One minor issue I encountered was that some of the orange paint on the targets seemed to smudge or fade after several uses, but it didn't significantly impact my overall experience with the product. This could be something to consider if you plan on using them for an extended period of time.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product for casual shooters looking for an affordable yet high-quality target solution. With its vibrant coloring and durable paper construction, this target provides excellent value for money and has become my go-to choice when heading out to the range!

### [Official USPSA/IPSC Practice Paper Target, Model: B29](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="action-target-b29-black-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-b29-black-100pk-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've spent countless hours perfecting my aim and technique. Recently, I decided to give Action Target's B29 Black 100pk a try for my home practice sessions. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. The heavy paper and precise printing make each shot feel satisfying and accurate.

The targets are easy to set up and can withstand multiple rounds without falling apart. This means even on those hot summer days when the sweat is pouring down my face, I can maintain my focus on improving my skills. Plus, the compact size of the targets means I can store them easily when not in use.

However, there's one minor downside to these targets – they aren't reactive. While some shooters may prefer this for a more serious practice environment, I do sometimes miss the instant gratification of a pop-up target or the satisfying sound of hitting steel. But overall, the Action Target B29 Black 100pk has been a valuable addition to my training regimen.

### [High Quality Heavy Duty Sharpshooter Spinner Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new targets to mix up my practice sessions. When I came across the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target, I knew I had to give it a shot. This sturdy target, made of heavy steel, boasts two targets of different sizes - a 2 1/4" one and a slightly larger 3 5/8" one.

What I particularly appreciated about this target was its versatility. Designed for use with soft nosed. 22 rimfire rifles and handguns, it provides a fun challenge even for experienced shooters like myself. However, be sure to avoid using it with centerfire handguns or rifles, as this could cause damage to both the target and your weapon.

Another highlight of this target is its distinct American make and quality. Crafted in the USA, it certainly stands out from other imported targets that may lack the same level of durability.

However, there are some cons to consider as well. Some users have reported difficulties hitting the smaller disc at longer distances due to its size. Additionally, the target does not deform on impact with some bullet types, which can cause wear and tear over time.

Overall, the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target is an enjoyable addition to any shooting range. Its quality build, different target sizes, and American origin make it a solid choice for those looking to add some variety to their practice sessions.

### [Durable 6-Sided Arrow Target for Fast Speeds](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="morrell-high-roller-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/morrell-high-roller-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using Morrell High Roller Target for a few weeks now and I must say, it's a decent choice for archery enthusiasts. It's lightweight and portable, which makes it easy to carry in my truck. I've been using it to test my bow while out in the field and even shot it with a few broadheads. The bullseyes are easy to see, thanks to the contrasting colors.

One feature that stands out is its ability to stop arrows from compounds and crossbows with speeds up to 450 fps. That's impressive considering it's a foam target. However, I haven't tried shooting a lot of broadheads into it as the foam started to show signs of damage after a few shots. So, for heavy use with broadheads, this might not last as long. But overall, it does its job well, especially with field points.

The High Roller Target comes pre-drilled for easy mounting, and it's weather-resistant, meaning you can leave it outdoors without worrying about the paint fading away quickly. The EZ-Tote carrying handle is a nice touch, making portability more convenient.

One thing that caught my attention is the 6-sided target with 21 bullseyes. So, even if you manage to shoot out one side, there are still plenty of targets left on the other sides. It's a good way to save space and money since you don't need multiple targets for practice.

In conclusion, the Morrell High Roller Target is a solid choice for archery practice, especially for compounds and crossbows. It works well with field points, but might not last long with repeated use of broadheads. The easy arrow removal, 6-sided design, and weather resistance features make it a worthy investment for any archery hunter.

### [Durable Metal Squirrel Airgun Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gamo-squirrel-field-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gamo-squirrel-field-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently encountered the Gamo Squirrel Field Target and thought it was an excellent investment for improving my air rifle skills. The target itself is well-built and sturdy, perfect for outdoor shooting. I was blown away by how simple the setup was – just attach the stakes to the bottom of the target and start shooting.

One standout feature of the Gamo Squirrel is its design that makes it fall down when you hit the yellow bullseye. This has made my practice sessions not only more challenging but also much more rewarding when I finally hit the right spot.

However, there are some downsides to this product that can't be ignored. For instance, the back stakes tend to come loose over time because they're constantly being pulled on when you reset the target with the cord. I ended up using a large piece of lumber to provide extra support.

Another issue is that the paint on the target gets worn off after around 200-300 shots. Although it's not a major problem, it would be nice if there were an option to apply a more durable finish.

In conclusion, the Gamo Squirrel Field Target offers hours of fun and challenging practice for air rifle enthusiasts. Despite some minor drawbacks, I believe it's a worthwhile addition to anyone's outdoor shooting setup.

### [Lacrosse Shooting Target for Improved Accuracy](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outdoor-shooting-target?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="franklin-sports-lacrosse-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/franklin-sports-lacrosse-shooting-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Franklin Sports Lacrosse Shooting Target for a few weeks now and I am genuinely impressed. It's an excellent training aid for not only my kids but also me. Its heavy-duty construction has withstood our toughest shots, which is a testament to its durability.

One aspect that I particularly like is how easily it attaches to our 6' x 6' lacrosse goal with the bungee straps provided. This target has truly helped us improve our shooting skills. We've been able to refine our shots by aiming for the corners, making us more confident in our game.

Of course, no product is perfect. It can be a little tricky to set up initially, but once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing. Plus, the corners of the target get dirty quite quickly, which requires regular cleaning.

Despite these minor inconveniences, overall, the Franklin Sports Lacrosse Shooting Target is a worthwhile investment for any lacrosse player looking to improve their skills. Its durability, ease of installation, and impact on improving our shooting accuracy make it a valuable addition to our training regimen.
