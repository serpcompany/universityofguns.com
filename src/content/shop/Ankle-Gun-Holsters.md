Experiencing the Die Hard Ankle Rig holster is like having a reliable partner for your daily carry routine. The combination of top-grain saddle leather and a robust PU coating make it incredibly durable and sleek. The holster's smooth leather lining both protects your gun's finish from scratches and provides an effortless draw, making it an excellent choice for those who value a swift response.

The neoprene leg band, padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, ensures maximum comfort all day long. However, some users might find the initial break-in period to be longer due to the stiffness of the leather, but after a few days of use, it will become more flexible and conform to your body shape nicely.

One thing to keep in mind is that this holster is designed primarily for right-handed users as it allows for a natural right-hand draw. Overall, the Die Hard Ankle Rig holster is highly recommended for anyone looking for a high-quality ankle holster that delivers on both performance and longevity. Its features make it well worth its price point, and its comfort and reliability during daily use make it stand out among other options in the market.

### [Concealed Leather Ankle Holster for Sig P365 (Right Hand, Black)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=concealed-leather-ankle-holster-for-sig-p365-right-hand-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-sig-p365-014pc8jz0-color-right-black-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-sig-p365-014pc8jz0-color-right-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-sig-p365-014pc8jz0-color-right-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried the DeSantis #014 Die Hard Ankle Rig, and I must say it has been quite a pleasant experience. Its construction using top-grain saddle leather with a PU coating ensures not only longevity but also excellent performance. The smooth leather lining both protects the gun's finish and allows for an efficient, silky draw.

The padded neoprene leg band, lined with sheepskin, is undeniably comfortable to wear even during prolonged use. However, the conventional thumb break adds an extra layer of security which gives me added peace of mind when carrying my firearm in this holster.

One possible downside of this holster is its overall size which may require wider pant legs; this could cause some issues with printing depending on your dress code. But regardless of that minor issue, if you're searching for a reliable concealment holster that combines style, comfort and quality materials - the DeSantis #014 Die Hard Ankle Rig might be perfect for you!

### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

I recently tried the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster and I have to say, it's one of the best ankle holsters I've come across. The Kodra nylon material is incredibly durable and comfortable to wear directly against the skin. The soft knit fabric lining adds an extra layer of comfort, and the closed cell foam acts as a moisture barrier, making it suitable for all-day use.

One feature that really stands out for me is the adjustable strap with a hook & loop fastener. It allows me to securely fasten the holster around my ankle, ensuring that my weapon stays in place no matter how much I move around. The fact that it's available in both right and left-hand models is a nice touch as well.

However, there is one issue that I've noticed. The ankle strap is not adjustable, which might be a problem for people with larger or thinner ankles. It took me a while to find the perfect fit, but once I did, it felt incredibly comfortable and secure.

Overall, this ankle holster has quickly become my go-to choice for concealed carry. The combination of comfort, durability, and adjustability makes it a fantastic option for anyone looking for a reliable and effective ankle holster.

I recently decided to upgrade my EDC carry with the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Sig P365. From the moment I put it on, I knew I made the right choice. The combination of top grain saddle leather and a PU coating makes it not only incredibly comfortable but also extremely durable. This puppy was built with longevity and performance as primary concerns, and it shows.

The smooth leather lining is a huge plus too. It not only protects my gun's finish but also offers a quick and silky draw. The Die Hard Ankle Rig features a tough leather lined holster with a conventional thumb break that's been attached to a neoprene leg band. The leg band is padded with foam and lined with sheepskin, making it feel like a second skin on my calf.

One thing I've noticed when wearing this ankle rig is how confidently I can carry it. The neoprene leg band and calf strap do an excellent job of keeping it secure and in place. Plus, the fact that it's both handsome and comfortable is just icing on the cake.

Of course, no product is perfect. One minor issue I've encountered is that the overall set up can be slightly wider than expected, leading to a bit of 'printing' when wearing certain types of pants. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such an excellent ankle rig.

All in all, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig is my new go-to for concealed carry. It's comfortable, secure, and built like a tank. If you're in the market for an ankle holster, look no further – this bad boy will get the job done and then some.

However, as with any product, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the calf strap's rough edges, while others have found the leather to be slightly bulky under certain types of pants. Additionally, like any leather product, it may require some breaking-in time before becoming fully comfortable.

Overall, I highly recommend the Gould & Goodrich B816-G42LH Ankle Holster Plus Garter for those seeking a reliable and comfortable concealed carry option. Its high-quality materials and thoughtful design make it an excellent choice for everyday use.

I recently had the chance to try out Galco's Ankle Glove, an ankle holster designed for deep concealment. As someone who prefers this type of carry option, I was eager to give it a shot. The Ankle Glove's wide neoprene ankle band and hook-and-loop closure not only offer extended wearing comfort but also provide unmatched security. This feature is particularly important to me, as I need a holster that can securely hold my firearm during long shifts where I'm constantly on the move.

Additionally, the reinforced thumb break for speed of draw and detailed molding for firearm retention showcase Galco's attention to detail and dedication to quality craftsmanship.

However, I did encounter one minor issue: the lack of an adjustable calf strap. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me, it would have been nice to have the option to purchase it separately. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and comfort provided by the Ankle Glove, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable ankle holster.

### [TheCHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=thecheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox)

When it comes to my everyday carry, being able to secure my firearm discreetly and comfortably is a top priority. That's why I decided to give the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster a try. I'm not one for flashy options, so the Gun Sox in black really caught my eye.

From the moment I put it on, I was impressed by the smooth draw and the fact that there was no shifting or sliding down my leg. It was so comfortable that I forgot I was carrying my firearm, which is a huge plus for me.

One feature that stood out was the proprietary Pant Protector. This little addition prevented any damage to my pant leg fabric from the gun sight, which was a nice surprise.

Despite this minor inconvenience, I believe that the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster is definitely worth considering for anyone looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their small to mid-sized firearms.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to concealed carry, ankle gun holsters are a practical and comfortable option for firearms storage. To ensure you're choosing the best ankle holster for your needs, consider these key features and considerations:

### Retention

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ankle-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=ankle-gun-holsters&utm_term=ankle-gun-holsters-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ankle+Gun+Holsters-2/public" alt="Ankle Gun Holsters-2"></a></div>

One of the most important aspects of an ankle holster is whether it securely retains your weapon. Look for holsters made from high-quality materials that feature strong, reliable fasteners. Some models also include adjustable retention straps, which allow you to customize the fit to your specific firearm.

### Comfort

Comfort is essential when wearing an ankle holster, especially during extended periods. Opt for a holster made from breathable materials, such as neoprene or nylon, that help prevent sweat buildup. Additionally, choose a design that is adjustable so you can achieve the perfect fit around your ankle.

### Concealment
