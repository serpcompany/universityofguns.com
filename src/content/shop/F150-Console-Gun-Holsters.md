### [Secure Vehicle Center Console Safe for Valuable Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=f150-console-gun-holsters&utm_term=secure-vehicle-center-console-safe-for-valuable-storage)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=f150-console-gun-holsters&utm_term=tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1"><img alt="tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tuffy-360-01-security-console-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Tuffy Security Console Safe has been an excellent addition to my vehicle center console, providing both security and convenience. The strong construction consists of 1/8-inch welded steel components and a Pry-Guard locking system, ensuring that thieves stay at bay. The exclusive 10 tumbler double bitted lock adds an additional layer of protection for my belongings.

The console safe is cleverly hidden inside the OEM console, making it nearly impossible to detect by passersby. The installation process was smooth sailing; following the provided instructions and taking my time didn't present any significant challenges. The weather resistant lid design incorporates an exclusive hinging system with a built-in lid stop, which comes in handy when accessing items inside the safe without fear of the lid slamming down on my hands.

One feature that I appreciate is how seamlessly the safe integrates with my vehicle's center console while still maintaining its original functionality – it even accommodates for OEM 12-volt ports! Now I can store valuables such as cash or personal documents securely while on the go, without worrying about them being stolen or damaged by environmental conditions like rain or snow.

As for any areas of improvement, I would have appreciated more precise guidance during installation regarding which specific parts needed adjustment for a perfect fit in certain vehicles (mine required some slight modifications). Additionally, though discreetness is vital for this product's success as a security measure - perhaps offering different color options could make it more visually appealing to varying tastes and preferences from consumers? Despite these minor points, overall this Tuffy Security Console Safe has exceeded expectations in providing top-notch protection alongside ease of use!

I recently added the DU-HA Underseat Storage to my 2007 Ford F-150 Supercab, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. I had been struggling with where to store all my gear, especially during road trips. The DU-HA solves that problem beautifully.

Not only does it fit perfectly under the seat of my truck, but its heavy-duty polyethylene plastic construction ensures that my stuff stays safe and secure. Plus, it's available in several colors to match my OE interior, which is a nice touch.

One of the best features is the inclusion of dividers that also double as gun racks, keeping my guns upright and organized. It's like having a secret storage compartment that only I know about!

Of course, no product is perfect. During installation, I did struggle a bit to get it to fit perfectly with my existing stock back seat. However, once it was in place, I was blown away by how convenient it made my life.

In conclusion, the DU-HA Underseat Storage has truly enhanced the functionality and versatility of my truck. If you're looking for a way to organize your gear and keep it safe and hidden, I highly recommend giving this product a try!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/f150-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=f150-console-gun-holsters&utm_term=du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/public"/></a></div>

I never thought I'd find an underseat storage solution as perfect as the DU-HA Underseat Storage. I've been using this hidden gem for quite some time now, and it has truly changed the game in terms of keeping my valuable gear safe and organized while I'm on the go.

The best thing about this product is how well it blends with the truck's interior, making it virtually invisible when the seat is folded up. It's like having a secret compartment that no one knows about! Plus, its compatibility with my 1999-2007 Chevrolet Silverado/Sierra Extended Cab model truck means it's a perfect fit for both style and function.

Another highlight is the built-in organizers and gun racks, which have made storing my shotguns and rifles so much easier and more secure. I appreciate how durable the heavy-duty polyethylene plastic construction is, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are protected from any potential harm.

However, there have been a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the installation process can be a bit tricky for some, especially if you're not familiar with working on vehicles. Secondly, while the compatibility with 1999-2007 models is excellent, it may not be suitable for those with later model years or other truck brands.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the DU-HA Underseat Storage to anyone looking for an efficient and discreet way to store their gear. It's truly a game-changer that has made my daily life much more organized and worry-free.

I recently upgraded my F150 with the DU-HA Underseat Storage Console Gun Holsters and I couldn't be happier! This ingenious device makes use of the dead space under your rear seat, transforming it into a hidden, organized storage area for my gear, tools, and yes, even my guns.

What I absolutely love about this product is how it's custom made for each pickup truck model, year, make, and cab size. It fits like a glove under my truck's rear seat, giving the appearance of a factory-installed accessory. The installation process itself was incredibly easy and quick.

Another highlight is that many models come with adjustable gun racks and storage dividers, making it a perfect fit for hunters like me. Plus, some models even come with a key locking lid for added security.

Now, let's talk about the flaws. A few users mentioned that their storage units were made of thin, flimsy plastic. I've not experienced this issue with mine, but it's something to keep in mind.

Another potential drawback is that the lid doesn't stay open on its own. You have to hold it open while accessing your belongings. However, this is a minor inconvenience at most.

All things considered, the DU-HA Underseat Storage Console Gun Holsters is a fantastic addition to my pickup truck. It's made a world of difference in terms of organization and convenience. If you're in the market for a similar product, this might just be what you need!

When I first got my hands on the Red Hound Auto Under Seat Storage, I was honestly skeptical. I had tried other solutions before, and they were either too much of a pain to install or just didn't fit well. But this one was different. It was super easy to set up – even without dividers – and it's custom designed to fit perfectly under the SuperCrew Cab's rear seat.

One thing that really stood out for me was the quick release attachment points. Unlike with other systems where you're fumbling and fighting to attach things, this one made it so simple and straightforward. Plus, it's sleek and rugged, just what I need when I'm storing all sorts of gear in there.

However, it wasn't all sunshine and roses. One issue I encountered was that there weren't any dividers included, which made organizing my stuff a bit tricky. And while the compatibility with my F-150 was perfect, I've heard from friends that it might not fit quite as well in other models.

Overall, I'd say the Red Hound Auto Under Seat Storage has been a game-changer for keeping my truck tidy and organized. If you're looking for a reliable storage solution that's easy to use and fits your specific vehicle, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a shot.

One of my favorite features is the easy installation process. With just a few bolts and a screwdriver, I was able to securely mount the safe in no time. Plus, the 4-dial lock ensures my valuables are kept safe and sound.

However, there is one minor drawback. The combo set can feel a tad stiff initially, but over time, they do loosen up a bit. I believe this is due to the high-quality materials used in constructing the safe.

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the 2018 Ford F150 Lock'er Down Exxtreme Console Safe. Its secure design and user-friendly installation make it a must-have accessory for any truck owner.
