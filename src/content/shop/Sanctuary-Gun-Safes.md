Besides features, consider these points when shopping for a Sanctuary Gun Safe:

- Size and dimensions: Take accurate measurements of your storage space to determine the appropriate size of your new gun safe. Remember to leave enough room for door clearance and any other obstacles in the area.

- Weight and mobility: Heavier gun safes are more difficult to move but generally offer better security and protection against theft or fire. However, if you need to transport your safe occasionally, look for one with built-in wheels or an easy-to-handle design.

- Price and budget: Gun safes vary greatly in price depending on factors like size, lock type, and features. Establish a budget before you begin shopping to help narrow down your options.

### Advice for Sanctuary Gun Safes

To maximize the effectiveness of your Sanctuary Gun Safe, follow these tips:

1. Periodically inspect and maintain your safe: Regularly check door hinges, lock mechanisms, and internal components for wear or damage. Address any issues promptly to ensure maximum performance and security over time.
