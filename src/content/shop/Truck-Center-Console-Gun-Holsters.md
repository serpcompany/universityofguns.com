<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="iwb-holster-mount-single-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/iwb-holster-mount-single-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the IWB Holster Mount and have been using it daily for a few weeks now. This product has truly transformed my daily carry experience, offering both convenience and peace of mind. The mount securely holds my holstered firearm in place, whether I'm at my office desk or driving in my truck. Its dual locking design provides assurance that the weapon won't fall out, even on bumpy roads.

One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost! With its lightweight design and dual locking mechanism, you can rest assured that your firearm remains safe and secure while on-the-go or stored away when not needed.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 5" Government, and let me tell you, it's been quite an experience. I've always been a fan of products made in the USA, so that was a big plus for me. What really impressed me was how easily I could transform this holster into different carrying positions: IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. It's like having four holsters in one!

The inclusion of the Holster Mount is a game-changer as well. It allows me to attach my ShapeShift to various surfaces in no time. However, there are a couple of cons to this otherwise impressive product. The first would be the bulkiness, especially when using the OWB setup. I find it too cumbersome for everyday carry, especially for those who aren't in a profession that requires it.

Another issue some users might face is the thumb release on the holster. It seems a bit wobbly and hard to push down when you need to use it. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still think the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is a solid choice for those looking for a versatile and modular holster for their 1911 5" Government.

### [Velcro Pistol Holsters for Gun Safes Handgun Storage Solution](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acorn-velcro-pistol-holsters-for-gun-safes-handgun-storage-solution-1/public"/></a></div>

Recently, I've been using the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters for my handgun storage solution, and it's been a game-changer. Before, I had to stack my firearms on the shelves, which not only took up a lot of space but also sometimes scratched their finishes. Now, with these clever holsters, I can store all of my handguns securely and make the most of the space inside my gun safe.

One of the main highlights of these holsters is their ease of use. Simply attach the Velcro side to a carpeted wall, insert your handgun, and boom! You've got a secure and accessible storage solution. No more clutter or scratched finishes, and best of all, no more stacking.

However, I did experience a minor inconvenience while installing these holsters. The screws that came with them were too short for my metal-door safe, so I had to visit Home Depot to purchase longer ones. Additionally, I would have preferred if the Velcro on the back of the holsters came with a plus or "X" pattern to eliminate any wobbling. But overall, these holsters have been a fantastic addition to my gun safe.

In conclusion, the Acorn Velcro Pistol Holsters provide a simple and effective solution for storing handguns in your gun safe. With their easy installation and accessibility, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them. So, if you're looking for a way to clear up some space and secure your handguns, I highly recommend giving these holsters a try.

### [Underseat Storage and Gun Rack For 1999-2007 Chevrolet & GMC Trucks](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-10003-underseat-storage-1/public"/></a></div>

I never thought I'd find an underseat storage solution as perfect as the DU-HA Underseat Storage. I've been using this hidden gem for quite some time now, and it has truly changed the game in terms of keeping my valuable gear safe and organized while I'm on the go.

The best thing about this product is how well it blends with the truck's interior, making it virtually invisible when the seat is folded up. It's like having a secret compartment that no one knows about! Plus, its compatibility with my 1999-2007 Chevrolet Silverado/Sierra Extended Cab model truck means it's a perfect fit for both style and function.

Another highlight is the built-in organizers and gun racks, which have made storing my shotguns and rifles so much easier and more secure. I appreciate how durable the heavy-duty polyethylene plastic construction is, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are protected from any potential harm.

However, there have been a few cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the installation process can be a bit tricky for some, especially if you're not familiar with working on vehicles. Secondly, while the compatibility with 1999-2007 models is excellent, it may not be suitable for those with later model years or other truck brands.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the DU-HA Underseat Storage to anyone looking for an efficient and discreet way to store their gear. It's truly a game-changer that has made my daily life much more organized and worry-free.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/du-ha-40012-underseat-storage-gun-case-black-1/public"/></a></div>

My experience with the DU-HA Underseat Storage has been nothing short of amazing. I've always struggled with keeping all my truck supplies organized, but this little gem has made it incredibly easy. The fact that it slides so conveniently under the seat of my truck leaves me more space in my cab for comfort and other storage.

The DU-HA has some really great features. It's specifically designed to fit my truck model, so it fits snugly and provides a lot of space. It also has dividers that not only help organize my stuff but can also be used as gun racks for my hunting trips. The construction is also quite sturdy, I can tell this thing is going to last a long time.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the height of the box is slightly lower than the bottom of the seat, which means some of my stuff peeks out from the sides. But it's not a dealbreaker by any means. I'm even thinking of customizing it to make it look neater.

Overall, I really like the DU-HA. It's incredibly easy to install and provides a lot of storage for all my truck essentials. If you're on the lookout for a high-quality underseat storage, the DU-HA is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-center-console-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-single-stack-sub-compact-left-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-single-stack-sub-compact-left-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Holster for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's a game-changer. It's perfect for those times when I need to secure my pistol but don't want the bulk of a hard polymer holster. The less rigid neoprene design is incredibly comfortable for wearing inside the waistband, and the grippy texture keeps it securely in place.

One feature that really stands out to me is the adjustable ride height and cant angle. This makes it super versatile and allows me to customize it to my specific needs. Plus, the high-density neoprene shell ensures that the trigger guard is always protected, even when the holster is worn in a more relaxed position.

However, I will say that the lack of a rigid structure might not be ideal for everyone. If you prefer a more secure hold on your firearm, you might want to consider a different type of holster. But for those who prioritize comfort and convenience, the Grip Tuck is definitely worth checking out.

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Pistol Holster is a fantastic option for those looking for a comfortable, versatile holster that offers excellent protection for their firearm. Its unique design and adjustable features make it a standout choice in the world of holsters. Give it a try and see for yourself!
