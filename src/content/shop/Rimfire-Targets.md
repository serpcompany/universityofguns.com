After using the Caldwell 5" Gong Target AR500 steel for several weeks, it's become a go-to target for my shooting sessions. The bright yellow color makes it easy to spot from afar, and the mounting holes offer versatility in hanging options.

Constructed out of AR500 hardened steel, this target has proved itself durable even when subjected to thousands of rounds at a maximum impact velocity of 3, 000 fps and up to 3, 500 ft lbs of energy. The compact design and lightweight construction make setup quick and easy.

A feature that stands out is the audible "ping" upon impact, providing real-time feedback on accuracy which helped improve my shooting experience. On the downside, I found that the target isn't as visible in low light conditions which can be problematic during early morning or late evening sessions.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as it offers excellent quality for its price point and has held up well throughout extended use. However, prospective buyers should note its visibility limitations during low light conditions.

## Buyer's Guide

### Important Features

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rimfire+Targets-2/public" alt="Rimfire Targets-2"></a></div>

When choosing rimfire targets, consider the material, visibility, and durability. The best targets are made from high-quality paper or metal materials that can withstand gunfire without easily tearing or bending.

Visibility is key when it comes to shooting targets. Make sure you choose a target with bright markings or contrasting colors that make it easy to see from a distance. Durable targets should have reinforced edges and sturdy mounting systems to withstand repeated shots without falling apart.

### Considerations

Before purchasing rimfire targets, think about how you will use them and what type of shooting you will be doing. If you shoot outdoors, opt for weather-resistant targets that won't be damaged by wind or rain. For indoor use or close-range shooting, choose smaller targets with higher density for more accurate aiming.

Assess your skill level and desired practice goals. Beginners may prefer larger, easy-to-see targets, while experienced shooters might opt for more challenging smaller or reactive targets.

### General Advice

Always practice gun safety when using rimfire targets. Keep your firearms unloaded until ready to shoot and ensure you have a clear backstop behind your target to prevent stray bullets from causing injury or property damage.

It's a good idea to invest in a variety of target types and sizes to keep your practice sessions interesting and to help you develop different shooting skills. Remember to regularly inspect and replace damaged targets to maintain proper sight alignment and accuracy.

### Choosing the Right Target Stand

- Consider the weight and portability of the stand, especially if you'll be carrying it to different shooting locations.

- Choose a stand that can accommodate various target sizes and types, allowing you to switch up your practice sessions.

- Look for stands with adjustable heights and angles to simulate real-life shooting scenarios and improve your versatility.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rimfire+Targets-4/public" alt="Rimfire Targets-4"></a></div>

Rimfire targets are typically paper or steel targets designed for rimfire firearms, such as. 22 LR, . 22 WMR, and. 17 HMR. They provide a safe and effective means to practice shooting skills, improve accuracy, and engage in recreational activity.

### What are some common types of rimfire targets?

Some common types of rimfire targets include:

- Paper targets: These are available in various designs, sizes, and colors, allowing shooters to practice accuracy, sight alignment, and grouping at various distances.

- Steel targets: Steel targets are more durable and can withstand a higher volume of shots without needing replacement. They are available in various sizes and shapes, such as spinners, poppers, and plate racks.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rimfire-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rimfire+Targets-5/public" alt="Rimfire Targets-5"></a></div>

### How should I set up my rimfire targets?

Before setting up your rimfire targets, ensure that your shooting area is at a safe distance from other people, buildings, and flammable materials.

Ensure that all targets are securely fastened to a stable surface, and that all bystanders remain a safe distance away from the firing line.

### How often should I replace my rimfire targets?

The frequency of target replacement depends on the type of target you are using and the volume of shots being fired. Paper targets may need replacement after a few shots or after several rounds, depending on your preference for target condition. Steel targets are generally more durable and can withstand thousands of rounds before needing replacement. Always inspect targets for damage before each shooting session, and replace them as necessary to maintain safety and accuracy.
