As a reviewer who has used the product, I found it to be an excellent choice for carrying outside the waistband due to its durability, compatibility with various attachment options, and precision molding. The adjustable retention feature allowed me to fine-tune the fit of the holster around my firearm, providing both comfort and security.

The proprietary blend of polymers proved to be very durable during my use, and I appreciated the positive locking trigger guard and IDPA legal optic ready speed cut that kept my firearm securely in place even during rigorous training sessions. Additionally, the compatibility with a wide range of belt attachments added versatility to this holster.

However, there were a few initial adjustments needed regarding fitment and retention strength adjustment which were easily rectified by simply loosening or tightening screws.

## Buyer's Guide

### Considerations when choosing the right M18 holster

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m18-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=m18-holsters&utm_term=m18-holsters-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/M18+Holsters-2/public" alt="M18 Holsters-2"></a></div>

When it comes to purchasing an M18 holster, there are several important aspects to take into account:

- Comfort: Ensure the holster you select offers a comfortable fit that allows for easy drawing and re-holstering of your M18.

- Retention and Security: Look for a holster with strong retention features that will secure your gun safely and without difficulty.

- Concealment: If necessary, consider choosing a holster designed for concealed carry that effectively hides your firearm without compromising comfort or accessibility.

- Weather-resistance: If you plan to use your M18 holster outdoors, make sure it is suitable for the intended environment, including weather resistance.

- Compatibility: Ensure the holster is specifically designed for M18 firearms to guarantee a proper fit and operation.

### Important features to look for in an M18 holster

In addition to the considerations mentioned above, there are several features that are commonly found in high-quality M18 holsters:

- Adjustable Cant: A holster with adjustable cant allows you to position your firearm at an angle that feels most comfortable and natural for you.

- Thumb Break: A thumb break strap provides extra security by requiring a second step (releasing the thumb break strap) when drawing your firearm, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to your weapon.

- Kydex or Similar Materials: Holsters made from strong and durable materials, such as Kydex, can provide better retention and longer-lasting performance compared to cheaper alternatives.

### Types of M18 holsters

M18 holsters come in various styles and configurations to cater to different user preferences and needs:

- IWB (Inside-The-Waistband) Holsters: These holsters are designed to be worn inside the waistband of your pants, providing discreet carry options and good retention. However, they may not be ideal for those who prefer a more comfortable, external-carry solution.

- OWB (Outside-The-Waistband) Holsters: Designed to be worn on the waistband outside your pants, these holsters generally offer greater ease of access and more comfortable carry options. However, they may not be suitable for those who prioritize discreet carry.

- Ankle Holsters: Ankle holsters allow for discreet carry while also keeping the gun concealed and secure. However, they may not be the most practical option for quick access to your weapon.

- Pocket Holsters: Pocket holsters are specifically designed to be carried in a front or back pant pocket, providing both concealment and quick access to your firearm. However, they may not be as secure as some other carry options.
