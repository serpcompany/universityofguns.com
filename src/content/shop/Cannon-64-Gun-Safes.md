<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-64-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cannon-64-gun-safes&utm_term=cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1"><img alt="cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-signature-gun-safes-gray-gloss-1/public"/></a></div>

I have recently been using the Cabela's Signature Gun Safe in my home, and it has been a game-changer in terms of storing and protecting my valuable firearms. This safe not only offers ample space to store up to 64 long guns, but it also uses a robust mechanical lock to ensure secure entry.

One of the standout features of this safe is its 11-gauge, plate steel construction, which is further strengthened by robotic welds and extra-thick Tough Doors. Additionally, the anti-pry tabs enhance the pry resistance by a whopping 300%, providing me with peace of mind when it comes to protecting my valuables.

The mechanical lock is another commendable aspect of the safe. It offers secure and effortless opening, while its spring-loaded external relockers ensure that the safe remains sealed when the mechanism is indeed breached.

One minor downside worth mentioning is that the handling of this heavy-duty safe could be more user-friendly. At 845 lbs, it can be quite a feat to move and install. However, this drawback is well worth the robust protection and storage that the Cabela's Signature Gun Safe provides.

In conclusion, if you're seeking a safe secure that not only protects your firearms but also provides ample storage space, the Cabela's Signature Gun Safe is an excellent choice.

However, I have encountered a couple of hiccups along the way. First, the provided mechanical keys for the lock didn't work, which was quite disappointing, especially for a high-priced safe. Second, the placement of the motion sensor for the LED lights could use some improvement to make it more convenient to access in the dark.

Overall, the Sports Afield Insignia Series 60-Gun Safe has been a reliable and efficient addition to my home, ensuring the safety of my valuable belongings. Even though it comes with a few minor drawbacks, the protection and sturdiness it provides far outweigh the cons.

A few months back, I got myself a Browning Hell's Canyon Gun Safe to store my collection of rifles and firearms. This safe is quite a beauty, with an unmistakable browning touch and a robust design that screams reliability. The first thing that caught my eye was its capacity of 48 cubic feet, which was more than adequate for my needs. Its dimensions, 56 inches wide, 60 inches high, and 25 inches deep, allowed me to place it along a wall without sacrificing valuable floor space.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this safe. The spacing of the storage locations can be a bit challenging, particularly for smaller firearms. This issue may result in some wasted space, but overall, it's still quite a convenient storage solution. The depth of the safe may also be a concern for modern firearms with a pistol grip, as it could lead to problems when organizing your collection.

In conclusion, the Browning Hell's Canyon Gun Safe has been a trusty companion in keeping my firearms and rifles secure. Its robust design, impressive fire rating, and ample storage capacity make it a worthwhile investment for any gun enthusiast. While there may be some minor issues in terms of firearm organization and space utilization, the overall benefits significantly outweigh these drawbacks.
