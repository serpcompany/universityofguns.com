### [Stylish Modern Sleeper Chair with Storage Pocket](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/byrna-nylon-waistband-holster-bh68311-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who loves to carry my Byrna for self-defense, having a comfortable holster that allows me to do so both inside and outside the waistband is a huge plus.

What really stood out to me about this holster is its minimalist design. It's lightweight and slim, making it easy to forget I'm wearing it until I need to access my Byrna. The open-muzzle bottom gives me plenty of room to grab my launcher quickly and securely, which is essential in a self-defense situation.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this holster. Some users have mentioned that it can be difficult to re-holster the launcher, especially after a few uses. Additionally, the magazine release button on some models may stick out too far, causing the magazine to be ejected inadvertently.

Overall, I've been very satisfied with my Byrna Nylon Waistband Holster. Its comfortable design and versatile carry options make it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their Byrna with ease and confidence.

The highlight of this holster for me is the custom molded polymer front. It's specifically shaped to fit my weapon perfectly, ensuring a secure fit and easy draw. Another standout feature is the closed-cell foam padding that keeps the weapon away from my body, preventing any discomfort or sweat buildup.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the holster tends to scratch the slide of my gun. It's not a deal breaker, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be concerned about maintaining the condition of their firearms.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/concealed-handgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.
