I recently purchased the Crossbreed Holsters Magna-Arm Gun Mount and I am thoroughly impressed! The night I installed it under my bed, I felt a lot safer, knowing that my weapon was within reach if needed. The magnetic rubberized surface is not only super secure, but also protects my gun from scratches.

Plus, it can be installed anywhere from under a table to behind a headboard, giving you the flexibility to secure your gun wherever you feel most comfortable.

However, there's no denying that the installation process can be a little daunting for some people. You do need to drill holes to attach it, but once installed, it's worth every effort. The other minor downside is that if you want to store long guns, you need two of these mounts, which might add up in terms of costs.

Its magnetic power ensures that your weapon stays put, ready to use when you need it most.
