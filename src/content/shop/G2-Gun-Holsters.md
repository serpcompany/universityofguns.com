### [Taurus G2C/G3C Holster with Level II Retention](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=taurus-g2cg3c-holster-with-level-ii-retention)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=gun-flower-taurus-g2c-holster-owb-holster-fits-taurus-g2c-g3c-taurus-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-outsi-1"><img alt="gun-flower-taurus-g2c-holster-owb-holster-fits-taurus-g2c-g3c-taurus-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-outsi-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-flower-taurus-g2c-holster-owb-holster-fits-taurus-g2c-g3c-taurus-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-outsi-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gun & Flower holster with my Taurus G2C for some time, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. The precision molding system ensures a perfect fit, while the sturdy construction assures durability. The Level II Retention index finger release system is impressive - it prevents any accidental release and delivers a smooth draw when needed.

The 360-degree adjustable paddle with the soft silicon attachment adds another layer of comfort, securing the holster to my belt without any issue. The POSI-CLICK Locking Feedback feature is also noteworthy - you get an audible click when your weapon is in place, giving that extra assurance of safety.

There are a few areas where it could improve, like more color options or a slightly less bulky design for discreet carry but overall, this holster has proven to be a reliable option in my daily routine. It meets all my requirements and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something similar for their own use.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-taurus-g2c-g3c-glock-29-31"><img alt="cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-taurus-g2c-g3c-glock-29-31" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambidextrous-hip-holster-taurus-g2c-g3c-glock-29-31/public"/></a></div>

A few weeks back, I got myself this Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. This holster is like a comforting hug for my Taurus G2C/G3C, offering not only protection but also easy access when needed. Made from tough 600-denier nylon, it's got a nice brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed cell foam for that extra layer of security. Plus, the belt loop attachment makes it super convenient to slide onto my belt.

I've been using this holster for daily carry and must admit, I've gotten quite attached to it. The adjustable straps have been a lifesaver (or should I say, gun-saver), providing the perfect fit for my preferred carry position. And speaking of preference, the fact that it's ambidextrous has been a real bonus, giving me the flexibility to switch things up if I feel like it.

However, one issue I had was with the straps. They're not the most user-friendly, to be honest. The velcro strap adjustment can be a bit tricky, requiring some patience and a touch of dexterity. But hey, you can't have everything, right?

In conclusion, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster has been a reliable companion in my daily life. It's lightweight, well-made, and has made carrying my Taurus G2C/G3C feel almost like a walk in the park. Highly recommended!

### [IWB Kydex Holster for Taurus G2S Slim (Gen 2)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=iwb-kydex-holster-for-taurus-g2s-slim-gen-2)

I recently purchased the Aggressive Concealment G2SIWBLP IWB Kydex Holster for my Taurus G2S Slim (Gen 2) and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily life. As a reviewer who is always on the go, I need a holster that not only secures my gun but also offers quick access when needed. This holster has definitely lived up to my expectations!

The first thing that caught my attention about this holster was its low profile design. It fits perfectly inside my waistband without creating any bulk or discomfort, making it ideal for long periods of wearing. Moreover, its sleek black color adds a touch of sophistication to my overall look.

One of the highlights of this holster is its adjustable retention feature. The screw located near the trigger well allows me to fine-tune the grip on my weapon, ensuring it stays securely in place even during rigorous activities. This has given me peace of mind knowing that my gun won't accidentally fall out or get stolen while I'm out and about.

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Upon receiving the product, I noticed that the retention was initially too loose for my liking. Thankfully, I was able to adjust it by drilling a new hole closer to the trigger well, as suggested by another reviewer. This minor inconvenience might deter some potential buyers who may not have the necessary tools or expertise for such adjustments.

All in all, the Aggressive Concealment G2SIWBLP IWB Kydex Holster Taurus G2S Slim (Gen 2) (Black, Right) offers exceptional quality and performance at an affordable price. While it may require some minor adjustments right out of the box, it's definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a reliable and comfortable holster.

### [Viridian Kydex IWB Holster for Taurus G3/G2 RH](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=viridian-kydex-iwb-holster-for-taurus-g3g2-rh)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=viridian-holster-iwb-taurus-g3-g2-rh-1"><img alt="viridian-holster-iwb-taurus-g3-g2-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viridian-holster-iwb-taurus-g3-g2-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

I'll be honest with you, when I first got my hands on the Viridian IWB Taurus G3/G2 RH, I was a little skeptical. After all, there are so many holsters out there claiming to be the best. But boy, was I proven wrong!

The first thing that struck me about this holster was how well it fits my E-series laser. It's like they were made for each other or something! The kydex thermoforming techniques really shine here, making sure that my laser stays secure and protected at all times. And speaking of security, the advanced CNC precision cut kydex shells definitely do their job - my Taurus G3/G2 feels snug and safe, ready to action whenever needed.

Made with high-quality materials, this holster screams durability and longevity. It's been through quite a few rough days with me, and still, it holds up like new. Oh, and did I mention it's tested in the harshest conditions? Yep, that means no matter where your adventures take you, this holster will keep your EDC system safe and sound.

However, nothing is perfect. While the holster is undeniably great, one issue I've noticed is that the belt clip can be a bit sticky sometimes, making removing the holster a bit challenging. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons with this one. If you're looking for a holster that offers concealment, retention, and a perfect fit for your E-series laser, look no further than the Viridian IWB Taurus G3/G2 RH.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/g2-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=g2-gun-holsters&utm_term=taurus-g3c-g2c-g2s-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-iwb-holster-black-carbon-fiber-left-hand-draw-iwb-amber-1"><img alt="taurus-g3c-g2c-g2s-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-iwb-holster-black-carbon-fiber-left-hand-draw-iwb-amber-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taurus-g3c-g2c-g2s-millennium-g2-pt111-pt140-iwb-holster-black-carbon-fiber-left-hand-draw-iwb-amber-1/public"/></a></div>

As an all-around shooter, I've been using the Amberide IWB Holster for my Taurus G3C and Millennium G2 pistols. This holster has been a game-changer in ensuring a comfortable carry while also providing a high level of protection for my firearms. The Kydex material provides a snug and secure fit, making it easy to conceal my weapon without any discomfort.

One of the standout features of this holster is its adjustable retention pressure. This allows me to customize the level of pressure required to release the firearm, ensuring a smooth and fast draw when needed. Additionally, the holster's cant adjustment feature has been incredibly helpful in tailoring the drawing angle to my personal preferences for optimal concealment and quick access.

However, there's one downside to this holster - its waterproofing. While it's a great feature for those unexpected downpours, I did find that the holster sometimes retains moisture, leading to a bit of condensation on the surface of my firearm. To mitigate this issue, I've taken to airing the holster out between uses to help keep my handgun in peak condition.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Amberide IWB Holster. Its lightweight design, robust materials, and adjustable features make it a top choice for those looking for a comfortable, secure, and reliable method of carrying their Taurus pistols. Highly recommended!
