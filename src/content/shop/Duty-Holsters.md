### [Adjustable Outside the Waistband Holster for Browning Hi-Power 9mm](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/duty-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=duty-holsters&utm_term=adjustable-outside-the-waistband-holster-for-browning-hi-power-9mm)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/duty-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=duty-holsters&utm_term=browning-hi-power-9-owb-holster-right-handed-browning-blade-tech-1"><img alt="browning-hi-power-9-owb-holster-right-handed-browning-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-hi-power-9-owb-holster-right-handed-browning-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for Browning Hi-Power 9mm and have been using it for a few weeks. Overall, I'm quite impressed with its performance. The holster is crafted in the USA from high-strength Boltaron material, providing excellent durability.

One standout feature is the adjustable retention screws, which allow you to easily customize the fit of your firearm in the holster. This ensures a secure hold while still allowing for smooth and quick access when needed. The positive locking trigger guard adds an extra layer of safety by giving you tactile feedback when securing your firearm.

The IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design allows for quick clearance from the muzzle out of the holster, which could give a competitive edge during competitions – though I haven't had the chance to test this due to COVID restrictions. However, practicing dry firing with this holster has shown how smoothly my gun slides in and out of it.

My only minor issue was some discomfort while wearing it on my belt for extended periods when sitting down – this was resolved by adjusting where I positioned it slightly higher on my waistband (at around 4 o'clock). This may not be an issue if you are able to make similar adjustments or prefer appendix carry (which I don’t generally use).

Overall, this is a high-quality product that delivers on its promises - fitting snugly against your body while offering easy access and reholstering capabilities. Highly recommended for anyone looking into purchasing one!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/duty-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=duty-holsters&utm_term=fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1"><img alt="fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster has proven to be a reliable and durable option for my FN FNX-45 Tactical. Its high-quality construction, crafted from Boltaron in the USA, provides a precise and secure fit that I can trust on the range or in competition.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the adjustable retention screws. These allow me to customize the level of security between my firearm and the holster with ease. Additionally, the optic ready speed cut design provides me with an edge during competitions by enabling quick clearance of the muzzle out of the holster. It's no surprise that both IDPA and USPSA have legalized this product for use in their competitions, further showcasing its effectiveness.

Another great aspect of this holster is its modular mounting holes which provide versatility when tailoring it to my specific draw and ride preferences using Blade-Tech's compatible attachments. The positive locking trigger guard also offers tactile feedback while storing my firearm safely throughout the day without any concerns about accidental exposure or loss.

However, there were some minor issues when initially setting up this product as some adjustment screws spun freely instead of securing into place once set up according to desired positioning - something which was resolved through customer support assistance via email correspondences within a reasonable timeframe nevertheless. Despite these small hiccups, overall –this remains a solid choice worth considering for those looking for reliable carry options.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/duty-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=duty-holsters&utm_term=fn-509-509-tactical-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1"><img alt="fn-509-509-tactical-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fn-509-509-tactical-classic-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

As a serious marksman, I've been using the Classic OWB Holster for my FN 509/509 Tactical for quite some time now and have found it to be a reliable and durable option. The ability to adjust the retention on this holster is one of its standout features, allowing me to customize the fit around my firearm to my personal preference. The fact that it's crafted in the U. S. A using high-strength Boltaron adds an extra layer of quality assurance.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the positive locking trigger guard which provides tactile feedback, letting me know when my gun is safely stored. Additionally, the IDPA & USPSA legal optic ready speed cut design allows me to clear my muzzle quickly and effectively, giving me an edge during competitions. However, there are some areas that could use improvement in future iterations of this holster model; notably, enhancing its compatibility with optics like HoloSun 507K without compromising holster draw or fitment quality would be great as this was something other brands were able to accomplish successfully. Furthermore, offering wider belt loops for more carrying options would also be a welcome addition.

Despite these minor issues, I still highly recommend this product due to its precision craftsmanship from high-quality materials made right here in America along with top-notch customer service provided by BladeTech's team should you ever need support downline - all of which contribute towards making this Classic OWB Holster truly worthy of consideration no matter what level shooter you might be!

The construction quality is superior and the finish is top-notch, making it not only functional but visually appealing as well.

One aspect I appreciate about this product is its versatility - it functions optimally as both an open carry or range holster worn outside the waistband (OWB). Furthermore, each holster is meticulously handcrafted to match your specific gun model ensuring a perfect fit for your firearm.

Some users have reported issues with finding the correct height setting on the paddle mount and challenges bonding with new equipment at first; however, these concerns seem relatively minor when weighed against the numerous positive attributes of Vedder Holsters' product line.
