### [Handgun Auto Reset Shooting Target for Practice and Competition](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=handgun-auto-reset-shooting-target-for-practice-and-competition)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-handgun-auto-reset-target-silver-1/public"/></a></div>

Using the Do-All Outdoors Handgun Auto Reset Targeting System on my backyard range has been a great experience. The durable steel construction and powder-coated paint held up well to my 9mm rounds, and the stabilizing ground spikes kept the target upright even when hit. I loved the forward leaning design that made bullet deflection downward, ensuring safety during practice sessions.

The high visibility targets were easy to aim at, and being able to practice without having to reset after every shot was a huge time saver. While there are some minor issues like pins holding the plates getting shot off or bent from time to time, these are easily remedied with replacement pins or nails. Overall, I recommend this product for those looking to make target practice more fun and efficient while improving accuracy.

### [1/4" AR500 Turkey Silhouette Targets for Rimfire Ammo](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=14-ar500-turkey-silhouette-targets-for-rimfire-ammo)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=nra-animal-silhouettes-turkey-1"><img alt="nra-animal-silhouettes-turkey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nra-animal-silhouettes-turkey-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the silhouette target set from ShootingTargets7 and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The high-quality materials used in construction make it built to last, and the satisfying ring when hit adds to the enjoyment of using these targets.

The 1/4" AR500 paddles can handle rimfire ammo without issue, making it a great choice for hours of shooting practice with friends or family. The different animal shapes (ram, pig, turkey, and chicken) add an extra layer of enjoyment while shooting. Even my niece was captivated by the targets and started naming the animals before aiming her shots.

The target is easy to set up, but a strong pair of pliers or channel locks is needed to compress the springs that hold the targets in place and attach the side legs to the main tube. However, once assembled, it is lightweight and portable for easy movement around your shooting area.

In terms of durability, these targets are top-notch as they have been shot over 3000 times according to other user reviews who have had them for months now! The deflection angle ensures bullets head towards the ground instead of ricocheting dangerously around you while you shoot. Plus, they're angled nicely so that when hit there is a nice swing movement too - another fun aspect about using these targets!

Overall this product has been a fantastic addition during our backyard shooting sessions; extremely well made with great attention paid towards detail in design features like material used (AR500) which handles rimfire ammo perfectly fine along with providing accurate results every time someone takes aim at one of their favorite critters on display here: Ram Pig Turkey Chicken. . . and yes even my niece loves playing 'Chicken Nuggets! ' whenever she hits her mark successfully against one such target standing tall amidst others awaiting their turn under fire! ! Highly recommended purchase if looking for some quality outdoor entertainment combined with skill building exercise through precision airgun/rimfire shooting experiences together w friends/family members alike! !

I recently started using the Rimfire NRA Animal Silhouettes target and it has really elevated my target practice experience. The 1/7. 5 scale animal silhouettes - Ram, Pig, Turkey, and Chicken - offer a thrilling challenge that keeps me engaged during my shooting sessions. I have found that this target is ideal for both novices learning the ropes and experienced marksmen looking to hone their skills.

This target is made of durable black zinc phosphate plated AR500 steel which can handle various rimfire ammo with ease, giving satisfying feedback when hit. I particularly appreciate its sturdy construction with leg and top bar made from EMT conduit; it's easy to set up and move around in the field or range thanks to its integrated hangers.

An initial minor issue was setting up the target as it required some strength using pliers or channel locks to compress the circular springs that hold everything in place securely but once set up, it proved its worth many times over during our various shooting sessions. Overall, this is an excellent product that delivers on its promise of quality and longevity while providing an entertaining twist on traditional target shooting.

### [Self-Healing Gong Shooting Target with Steel Stand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=self-healing-gong-shooting-target-with-steel-stand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nra-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=nra-targets&utm_term=do-all-big-gong-show-target-1"><img alt="do-all-big-gong-show-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-big-gong-show-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently bought this self-healing target for my backyard shooting range, and I'm thrilled with its performance. One standout feature is its 'self-healing' design, which works exactly as advertised. Even after firing thousands of rounds from various calibers, the holes seal up quickly so I can keep shooting without any issues.

Another aspect that impressed me was the sturdy steel stand, which is much more substantial than other products in the market. It easily supports long hours of heavy use without wobbling or tipping over. The 9-inch diameter target itself offers plenty of space for groupings or precision shots while remaining light and portable.

Although there were a couple of downsides - like difficulty seeing where shots landed - they didn't significantly impact my overall experience. Additionally, some users mentioned using sticky targets to improve visibility but had mixed results with adhesiveness. Despite these minor flaws, I highly recommend this durable and easy-to-use target for hours of fun at your own backyard range!

As a regular shooter, I've found the NRA targets to be highly reliable and impressive for my practice sessions. The weather-resistant paper is a game-changer, allowing me to shoot in all kinds of conditions without worrying about the target being ruined by rain or humidity. The centers are printed on high-quality stock and hold up well during use.

A major advantage of these targets is the ease of replacing the centers on full-sized targets, which not only saves money but also ensures I can get the most out of each target. It's great not having to deal with accidental tears in the middle of a shooting session. However, it's important to note that the furthest circle is labeled as 6 and not 10, which may take some getting used to for new users. Nonetheless, with each center measuring 10. 5" x 10. 5", there’s just enough space for pistol shooting within 10-15 yards without being too large or small for efficient target practice.

Overall, these NRA targets have proven their worth as durable options across various weather conditions while remaining budget-friendly - definitely worth considering if you’re looking for reliable and long-lasting shooting targets!
