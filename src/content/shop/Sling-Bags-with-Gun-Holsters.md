### [30" Alpha Battle Carrier Sling Pack with Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="utg-abc-sling-pack-30-multi-firearm-case-w-electric-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/utg-abc-sling-pack-30-multi-firearm-case-w-electric-blue-1/public"/></a></div>

The Leapers UTG 30 inch Alpha Battle Carrier Sling Pack has been an indispensable tool in my daily routine. Its discreet appearance and sturdy 900D polyester construction make it perfect for carrying my firearms with ease. The built-in ambidextrous pistol holster in the front top pocket is a great convenience.

However, the quick release buckle on the shoulder strap can be a little cumbersome when trying to quickly deploy my weapons. Additionally, the capacity of the pack can be easily filled when transporting more than one gun and their respective accessories.

Overall, the Leapers UTG Alpha Battle Carrier Sling Pack has proved to be a reliable and practical option for me. Its adjustable and comfort-padded features make it enjoyable to carry, even for longer periods.

If you are in search of a discreet, well-built, and feature-rich sling pack for your firearms, the UTG Alpha Battle Carrier Sling Pack may be the perfect choice.

### [NcSTAR Braided Shoulder Bag for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="ncstar-concealed-carry-braided-shoulder-bag-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ncstar-concealed-carry-braided-shoulder-bag-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this NcSTAR Concealed Carry Braided Shoulder Bag, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The braided straps give it a unique and fashionable appeal that stands out from your run-of-the-mill bag. Plus, the zipper closure makes accessing my stuff a breeze.

One thing that really amazed me was the size of this bag. I had my doubts when I saw the pictures, but trust me, it's massive! It's perfect for holding my iPad and even a. 357 magnum with room to spare. That's some serious firepower at your fingertips!

The bag also offers multiple storage options with three large zippered pockets along with a special area for your gun, complete with a holster and strong Velcro attachment. And if that wasn't enough, there are four smaller pockets at each side for keys and other smaller items.

However, it took me some time to get used to the size of the bag. It's definitely on the larger side, which might not suit everyone's taste. But hey, who doesn't love a big bag with plenty of room for your essentials?

All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the NcSTAR Concealed Carry Braided Shoulder Bag. Its fashionable design, ample storage options, and unbeatable price make it the perfect companion for any concealed carry enthusiast.

### [Tactical Sling Pack with Gun Holster and 34 Liter Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="red-rock-outdoor-gear-rover-sling-pack-coyote-olive-drab-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/red-rock-outdoor-gear-rover-sling-pack-coyote-olive-drab-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Red Rock Outdoor Gear Rover Sling Pack during a hunting trip with friends. As a guy who loves to stay organized and always prepares for the worst, this sling pack really stood out to me. The main compartment is large enough to fit my tablet, which came in handy while GPSing our way through the dense forest. The nine external pouches made it easy to access things like my binoculars, first aid kit, and some essential ammunition.

One of my favorite features has to be the MOLLE webbing platform on the front and shoulder strap. It allowed me to add more pouches and gear as needed, making this sling pack truly versatile. The ambidextrous shoulder strap with quick-release buckle made it super comfortable and convenient to access my concealed-carry pistol when needed.

However, there were a couple of cons that I noticed during my usage. Firstly, the color I received (Coyote/Olive Drab) wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It seemed a bit more muted than what was shown in the pictures. Secondly, the craftsmanship wasn't as high-quality as I had hoped for at its price point. The stitching felt a bit flimsy and I could see it potentially coming undone over time.

Overall, the Red Rock Outdoor Gear Rover Sling Pack is a useful and versatile bag for those looking for an everyday carry solution with room for a concealed-carry pistol. Just keep an eye out for any potential cons, like color discrepancies or questionable craftsmanship.

### [Buffalo Leather Concealed Carry Sling Backpack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gun-toten-mamas-buffalo-leather-sling-backpack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-toten-mamas-buffalo-leather-sling-backpack-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gun Tote'n Mamas Buffalo Leather Sling Backpack for my daily carry needs, and I must say it's been a game-changer. The quality of this bag is unmatched, made from vintage-tanned, full-grain buffalo leather, which not only looks great but feels super sturdy. Switching between carrying it on my back or swinging it to the front for quick access is a breeze.

One of my favorite features is the ample storage space - three external zip pockets and a large main compartment with two internal pockets (one with RFID protection). This allows me to keep everything organized and within easy reach. The side zip pistol compartment is also incredibly convenient, complete with a built-in holster for secure and simple drawing.

I also appreciate the slash-resistant 2"-wide shoulder strap, which features 11-ply steel wire reinforcements to ensure reliability even with heavier loads. The padding in the back makes it incredibly comfortable to wear, and it's versatile enough to be worn on either side of my body.

Despite these great features, there is one minor downside: the capacity might be a bit too limited for those who carry a larger weapon alongside other essential gear. However, for most users, the Gun Tote'n Mamas Buffalo Leather Sling Backpack offers a perfect balance of style, comfort, and functionality.

### [Tactical Sling Bag](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="viktos-upscale3-sling-bag-coyote-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viktos-upscale3-sling-bag-coyote-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Viktos Upscale3 Sling Bag in Coyote, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for me in terms of convenience and practicality. As an avid EDC enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for high-quality, versatile bags that can hold all my essentials, and this sling bag has certainly measured up to my expectations.

The first thing that struck me about this bag was its sleek design. It's not too bulky or tactical-looking, which is perfect for those who prefer a more subtle, low-profile appearance. Yet, despite its compact size, this bag truly packs a punch. The capacity is impressive, with enough room for my full-size pistol in the CCW compartment and other essentials like extra mags, a tourniquet, and a medkit in the main compartment.

One feature that really stood out for me is the ambidextrous sling. As a left-handed shooter, I often struggle with right-handed designs, but this bag caters to both left- and right-handers seamlessly. The CCW access compartment can be worn on either side of the body, making it incredibly easy to access my weapon in a self-defense situation. Plus, the gently padded sling ensures maximum comfort, even when loaded with heavier items.

Another aspect that I absolutely love is the storage design. The main compartment is equipped with elastic webbing and an internal cargo pocket, providing ample organization options for my various EDC items. Additionally, the padded upper compartment is the perfect spot for storing my eyeglasses safely.

However, it's not all roses â€“ there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this sling bag. Firstly, while the bag itself is lightweight, adding items like a red dot-equipped handgun can make it feel a bit heavier on one side. Secondly, the zippers, although smooth-running, can be a tad challenging to use with one hand, particularly when the bag is loaded up.

All in all, the Viktos Upscale3 Sling Bag has been a fantastic addition to my EDC lineup. Its well-thought-out design, combined with its impeccable build quality, make it an ideal choice for anyone in need of a discreet, reliable sling bag to carry their essential gear.

### [Discreet Concealed-Carry Messenger Bag for Outdoor Enthusiasts](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sling-bags-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fox-outdoor-43-21-deluxe-concealed-carry-messenger-bag-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fox-outdoor-43-21-deluxe-concealed-carry-messenger-bag-black-1/public"/></a></div>

First and foremost, the quality of this bag is top-notch. The cotton canvas material is durable and reliable, ensuring that my belongings will stay protected no matter where I am. In addition, the concealed carry pocket on the back of the bag is perfect for discreetly storing my weapon when I'm out and about.

One of my favorite features of this bag is the open top electronic tablet sleeve, which provides a convenient place to store my tablet without adding any extra bulk. Plus, the zippered accessory pocket is perfect for storing smaller items like my keys and wallet.

While I do appreciate the drain grommets in the two side pockets, there are some downsides. For one, the adjustable 2" wide cotton web shoulder straps could be more comfortable, especially if you're carrying heavier items. Additionally, the lack of a shoulder strap pad can make wearing the bag for extended periods slightly uncomfortable.

That being said, this messenger bag certainly stands out in terms of functionality and style. Plus, with its various compartments and pockets, it has proven to be incredibly versatile for my daily needs.

So if you're in the market for a high-quality messenger bag that can keep your weapon concealed and your belongings organized, I highly recommend giving this one a try.
