I've been using the Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe for a few months now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. As someone who values both security and style, this gun safe has delivered on both fronts. The 12-gauge steel and 1.5-inch chrome, steel bolts make me feel confident that my belongings are secure, while the deluxe interior with its deep grey foam-backed liner adds a touch of class.

The fire resistance feature is truly impressive – it can withstand fires for up to 75 minutes, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my firearms and documents are well-protected. The drill-resistant hard plate is another great security feature that adds an extra layer of protection. Additionally, the UL-listed, Type 1 rated S&G dial lock ensures that only I have access to the safe.

However, there is a minor issue with the lock mechanism, which can sometimes be a bit stubborn. Despite this, the pros easily outweigh the cons, making the Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of secure gun storage.

Nestled in your living room or tucked away in a bedroom, the Surelock Cadet 18 offers the perfect balance of style, functionality, and security. I've been using it for over a year now, and it's been a game-changer when it comes to safely storing my most valuable possessions. It's the mid-sized safe among the 40-minute fire rated Cadet Series, which I feel is an excellent choice for a beginner collector or someone seeking a modest amount of fire protection.

Initially, I was impressed with its exterior design in rich mocha with desert sand accents. It truly adds a touch of modern elegance to any living space. In addition to the beautiful exterior, I was pleasantly surprised by the practical interior features, including the three adjustable or removable light tan shelves. These adaptable shelves offer customizable storage options, accommodating my watch collection and firearms with ease.

One of the standout features is the adjustable interior door panel. This convenient feature maximizes storage space while providing easy access to smaller items such as keys, clips, or jewelry. Knowing that I could securely store my valuable belongings in this panel brought me peace of mind. The SecuRam digital lock and 1.25-inch bolts also provide an added layer of security.

However, after several months of use, I did encounter some minor drawbacks. The most notable issue was a minor dent on the top left corner of the safe. While this was disappointing, considering the safe's weight and shipping, such damage was not entirely unexpected. The provided floor mounting hardware was also subpar, requiring me to purchase a separate kit.

Overall, the Surelock Cadet 18 has been a reliable and stylish choice for safeguarding my valuables. While there were minor drawbacks, the positive aspects far outweighed any negatives. Its sleek design, adjustable interior features, and robust security measures make it a top pick in my book.

Overall, the SentrySafe 2-Gun Biometric Gun Safe QAP2BLX has proven to be a reliable and well-built safe, perfect for anyone looking to store their firearms securely and access them quickly when needed. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, its advanced locking system and solid construction make it worth the investment.
