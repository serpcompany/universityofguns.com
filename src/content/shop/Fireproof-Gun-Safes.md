### [Secure 18-Gun Compact Security Cabinet with Key Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I recently purchased the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. After using it for several months, I have noticed some positive aspects as well as a few areas where it could improve.

One great feature of this gun safe is the key-coded cylinder lock and 4-way door locking, providing me with a sense of security when I'm away from my guns. The molded barrel rests and foam-padded bottom also help protect my antique firearms from any dings or scratches. These features make the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe stand out in terms of protection for your weapons.

However, there are a couple of issues that I have encountered during use. The instructions provided were low in quality, making assembly a bit challenging. Additionally, some users have reported durability issues with certain parts such as hinges and door latches, which can cause concern when relying on this product to protect your valuables over time.

Overall, the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe does provide basic protection for your firearms with its sturdy structure and multiple locks. However, if you're looking for something more heavy-duty or long lasting in terms of construction quality, this might not be the ideal option for you.

### [Remington Express 44-Gun Safe: Fireproof, Waterproof, and UL-Rated Security for Protection and Craftsmanship](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Remington Express 44-Gun Safe has become a favorite addition to my home security setup, thanks to its impressive combination of fireproof and waterproof capabilities. The 12-gauge industrial steel body with Triple Seal technology provides excellent protection for my firearms and valuables in the event of a fire, while preventing internal damage from leaks or flooding.

Among the standout features are the SecuRam UL Rated electronic lock, twelve sturdy steel locking bolts, and a relocker device – all offering maximum security to keep my possessions safe from unauthorized access. The motion-activated LED lights installed inside the safe make it easy to locate and retrieve items in low light conditions.

The interior is fully carpeted and includes several storage options such as a deluxe pocket door organizer, barrel rests, and adjustable side shelves for customizing the setup according to your needs. Charging gun safe accessories at home is effortless with integrated UL Rated dual power outlets and two USB ports.

That said, it would have been great if there were additional padding on some areas of the doors or shelves to better protect more delicate items like scopes or other gear that could be potentially scratched by metal on metal contact while opening or closing doors quickly. Also, I find myself having slightly more difficulty when trying to use this item as an actual picture frame due to its weightiness - though this isn't necessarily surprising given its sturdy construction meant for long-lasting protection instead of purely decorative purposes; ultimately reinforcing why investment pieces like these should always be carefully considered based on their intended use cases before purchase!

This safe impressed me right from the moment it was delivered, with its industrial-grade steel construction and robust Uni-Weld body. The biometric lock allowed for easy programming of up to 100 unique fingerprints, providing both convenience and extra layer of security when accessing the contents inside.

What truly stood out to me was the Triple Seal technology, which forms a protective barrier against fire, water, and smoke damage. This feature brought immense peace of mind knowing that my valuables would remain safe in case of any unforeseen accidents or emergencies. The eight 1. 5-inch steel locking bolts on the door provide additional strength against break-in attempts or tampering, making this safe an excellent investment for any homeowner seeking reliable security.

The interior design is equally impressive, featuring a fully carpeted interior with a carpeted barrel rest for up to 40 guns positions, a Zero-Sag steel reinforced top shelf as well as three height adjustable/removable side shelves for flexible storage arrangement - perfect for organizing everything inside!

Overall, choosing this Preserve gun safe has exceeded my expectations by offering not only top-notch safety features but also user friendly aspects such as multiple entry options (biometric scanning or Fail Safe override keys).

### [High-Capacity 5 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/public"/></a></div>

Man, I've been using this 5 Gun Safe from American Furniture Classics for quite some time now. I've got to say, it's been a real game-changer in securing my firearms. The 3-directional bolt system along with the soft foam pad at the bottom has proved to be a real lifesaver when it comes to keeping my valuables safely stowed away.

One of the standout features for me has been the high strength steel construction. This thing is an absolute beast, providing me with an unmatched level of security. It's also got holes for mounting to the wall and floor, which gives me peace of mind knowing that it's going nowhere.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The keyed access can be a bit of a pain at times, especially when you're in a hurry. And while the high-strength steel is fantastic, the thing is quite heavy, making it a bit of a challenge to move around.

Overall, I've been quite happy with my purchase. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly done a great job of keeping my firearms safe and secure. So if you're in the market for a gun safe, this one's definitely worth considering.

### [5-Gun Secure Metal Storage Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet, and I must say, I'm quite impressed by its design and features. This compact cabinet is perfect for securing my long guns, and it definitely adds a sense of security to my home.

One of the standout features of this cabinet is its three-point locking system. It provides that extra layer of security that I was looking for. Additionally, the high-quality black powder-coated paint gives it a sleek and attractive finish.

Another aspect that I really like about this product is its soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor. This ensures that my firearms stay safe and intact, even during those tumultuous times when you might need to quickly retrieve them.

One downside to this cabinet, however, is its assembly. It comes fully assembled, which is a great feature for convenience, but it's not the sturdiest. There have been a few instances where the seams have come undone, causing some concern about the overall durability of the cabinet.

Despite this minor issue, the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet has been a great addition to my home. It provides peace of mind and ensures that my firearms are kept in a secure and organized space.

The fireproof and waterproof capabilities are a godsend, giving me peace of mind that my guns will stay safe, regardless of what nature or a misfortune might throw at them. Plus, the triple-seal protection is like having an invisible shield, warding off smoke damage and keeping my babies pristine.

This safe has seen more than just my guns. It's been a silent witness to family gatherings and late-night planning sessions with my hunting buddies. The quilted door organizer and handgun holsters ensure that everything has its place, keeping our man cave clutter-free and organized.

However, this mighty fortress does have a few quirks. The placement of the LED lights are a tad inconvenient, sometimes casting eerie shadows that can make it hard to locate that specific firearm you're searching for.

All things considered, the Remington Gun Club 52 Plus Gun Safe is a reliable and secure companion for any serious gun collector. It's a testament to the saying that good things come in protected packaging.

So whether you're preparing for the zombie apocalypse, or just looking to keep your family heirlooms safe, this sturdy and feature-rich safe will be your faithful ally.

### [6-Gun Security Cabinet with Fingerprint and Digital Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-6-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-fingerprint-digital-keypad-lock-gun-storage-cabinet-with--1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this Vevor 6 Gun Safe in my home for a few months now and it's been a game-changer for keeping my firearms safe and secure. The highlight features for me include the biometric lock, which is incredibly fast and reliable, and the digital keypad lock that ensures only authorized individuals have access. The storage options are also top-notch, with adjustable shelves to accommodate multiple firearms and accessories.

One thing that's not so great about this gun cabinet is its weight; at 82 lbs, it can be a bit cumbersome to move around or reposition in your home. Despite this minor inconvenience, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Vevor 6 Gun Safe to any firearm owner who values security and organization.

### [Ultra-Sturdy, 1-Hour Fire-Rated Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-75011-super-titan-modular-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Snapsafe 75011 Super Titan Modular Gun Safe, and I have to say, it's quite a unique piece of equipment. As someone who's always on the lookout for innovative solutions to everyday problems, the Super Titan caught my eye with its modular assembly system.

First off, let me tell you about the assembly process. It really did live up to its promise of being quick and easy. I was able to assemble the entire safe in just about an hour, with only a wrench that was included in the package. I didn't need any other tools, which saved me a lot of time and effort.

The Snapsafe is quite sturdy, thanks to its thick 9 gauge steel exterior walls. The 3/16" solid steel door is also quite impressive, offering resistance against sledgehammers and pry-bars. This level of protection is what you'd expect from a high-end safe, so it was definitely a pleasant surprise to find it in this product.

I was also quite impressed with the UL Listing for its 1-hour fire rating. This means that the safe can withstand up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour, providing ample protection for your valuable possessions.

However, there were a couple of things that left me feeling a bit underwhelmed about the Super Titan. The lock mechanism, for one, felt a bit cheap and delicate compared to other safes I've used in the past. Additionally, I couldn't find any stickers or certifications indicating that the safe had undergone proper testing for its fire rating.

Overall, I think the Snapsafe 75011 Super Titan Modular Gun Safe is a decent option for those looking for a modular and sturdy safe. It's not perfect, but it does offer some unique benefits that set it apart from other options on the market. If you can overlook its minor flaws, it's definitely worth considering for your personal safety needs.

### [Wasatch 64 Gun Safe with E-Lock for 64 Rifles](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="wasatch-64-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-64edbw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-64-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-64edbw-1/public"/></a></div>

The Wasatch 64 Gun Safe has been a game-changer for me. This sturdy and well-made safe provides ample storage for a variety of firearms, making it a must-have for avid gun enthusiasts. The most standout feature for me is the interior door storage, which provides extra compartments for keeping your smaller items organized and easily accessible.

One of my favorite highlights of this safe is the 180-degree full opening mechanism. It allows me to access all my stored items without any hassle. Another positive aspect is the backlit electronic lock, which is not only easy to use but also comes with an alarm function to deter theft attempts.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The first one is the weight. Moving this safe requires at least two or three people, and it's definitely not a one-person job. Secondly, the provided 9V battery tends to be of low quality, so it's best to invest in a high-quality battery for better performance.

In conclusion, the Wasatch 64 Gun Safe has been a valuable addition to my home. Its capacity, features, and security make it worth every penny. Despite its weight and the need for a better battery, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and secure gun safe.

### [Wasatch 18 Gun Fire and Water Safe with E-Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="wasatch-18-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-18egw-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wasatch-18-gun-fire-and-water-safe-with-e-lock-18egw-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this Wasatch 18 Gun Safe for a few months now, and I love it. The 1400-degree fire rating and waterproofing are impressive, giving me peace of mind knowing my guns are well-protected. The electronic lock with its alarm function is user-friendly; plus, the included backup key is a great added security measure.

One thing that really stands out is the full 180-degree opening, providing easy access to all my items. The door storage system has been really helpful, as well as the interior door storage that comes standard on this model. The security features, including the live action locking bolts and the extra protection offered by the recessed doors and tapered bolts, give me confidence that my belongings are secure.

Now let's talk cons. The safe doesn't actually fit 18 guns, but I've found that it comfortably holds about 8 rifles with plenty of space leftover for ammo, so it's not a deal-breaker for me. Another issue I've noticed is the limited wall-mounting options for anchoring the safe, which can lead to some slight rocking even when mounted properly.

All in all, I highly recommend the Wasatch 18 Gun Safe for anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and affordable long-gun safe. The quality and features provided at this price point make it a standout option in the gun safe market.

I've been using the Sports Afield Insignia Series 60-Gun Safe to secure my collection of long guns, handguns, and important documents, and let me tell you, it's been quite an experience. It has become the fortress of my home, protecting my valuable possessions from theft, fires, and other disasters. The full-seam Uni-Weld construction and SecuRam UL-Rated electronic lock make me feel confident in its ability to keep my belongings safe.

One of the highlights of this safe is its interior design. With built-in LED lighting, fully carpeted barrel rests, and adjustable shelves, I can easily find and access my items without causing any damage. Its Triple Seal protection feature also provides extra security and resistance against fire, water, and smoke damages, giving me peace of mind.

However, I have encountered a couple of hiccups along the way. First, the provided mechanical keys for the lock didn't work, which was quite disappointing, especially for a high-priced safe. Second, the placement of the motion sensor for the LED lights could use some improvement to make it more convenient to access in the dark.

Overall, the Sports Afield Insignia Series 60-Gun Safe has been a reliable and efficient addition to my home, ensuring the safety of my valuable belongings. Even though it comes with a few minor drawbacks, the protection and sturdiness it provides far outweigh the cons.

### [Multi-Functional Biometric Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sanctuary-platinum-fireproof-and-waterproof-security-safe-with-biometric-lock-32-75-h-x-20-25-w-x-20/public"/></a></div>

Sanctuary Platinum's Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe has been a game-changer in my home. The first thing that grabbed my attention was its sleek dark gray metallic finish, which gave a modern and secure look to the space.

The one feature that truly stood out was the biometric lock system. Programming it to recognize up to 100 fingerprints was a breeze, and the fail-safe override keys added an extra layer of security. However, the locking handle did have a slightly wobbly motion, which could be improved for a smoother experience.

The interior was well-lit with an LED light bar, making it easy to access items in the dim lighting of my storage room. The removable glass shelf and dedicated key storage hooks provided ample organization options. And while the safe doesn't have app compatibility or bluetooth connectivity, its primary purpose of secure storage was met without any issues.

During the usage, I did notice a few areas for improvement. The instructions mentioned the need for 4AA batteries, but only the front 9Volt battery was needed. The other two AA cells might be intended for the internal lighting, which this model does not have. Also, the seal around the door seemed a bit uncertain in terms of keeping water out. Adding an extra layer of dessicant beads and a recording hygrometer helped maintain a manageable level of humidity inside.

Overall, Sanctuary Platinum's Fireproof and Waterproof Security Safe has proven to be a sturdy, well-made safe that offers great protection for valuables. Its biometric lock system, spacious interior, and attractive design make it a worthwhile investment, despite a few minor hiccups in the overall experience.

### [Browning BF23E 23 Gun Safe with Hammer Gray Textured Finish](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/fireproof-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="browning-bf23e-23-american-flag-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bf23e-23-american-flag-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The exterior is designed with a Hammer Gray textured finish and features black hardware, giving it an aesthetically pleasing appearance. I also appreciate the single drop L-shaped Handle, which adds to the overall sleek design. The interior is just as impressive, with standard DPX quick access barrel rack and shelving, providing easy organization of my firearms and accessories.

One of the standout features for me was the Browning's Force Deflector Locking System, combined with the 12-gauge solid steel body and a 1" formed door. This ensures optimal security and protection for my valuable possessions. Moreover, the re-locker and hardened steel pins offer an additional layer of defense.

However, there's a minor downside to this safe. The floor, which is supposed to be 10-gauge steel, lacks rigidity and causes the safe to wiggle a bit when bolted to the floor. This could be a concern for some users, but it hasn't been a significant issue for me personally.

Overall, I found the Browning BF23E American Flag Gun Safe to be a visually appealing, well-crafted, and highly secure option for safeguarding my firearms. I'm happy to have made this purchase, and I'm confident in the safety it provides for my valuable collection.

As an avid gun collector, I've gone through my fair share of gun safes over the years. However, none of them have given me the peace of mind quite like the Tracker Safe 16-Gun has. This safe offers a secure and elegant storage solution for all of my guns and valuables, and it's fire-resistant too. The combination dial lock is a personal favorite of mine, as it provides that extra layer of security without the risk of losing a key or dealing with a finicky electronic lock.

The Tracker Safe's sleek black exterior not only looks great in my home but also offers protection from potential thieves. And the 16-gun capacity is more than enough for my current collection, with plenty of room to grow.

I recently had the opportunity to invest in a Liberty Safe's Colonial Series safe, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. As a firearms enthusiast, storage and security are paramount, and this model excels in both areas. The Level 4 Security feature, paired with the SecuRam backlit electronic lock, offers a sense of security I haven't experienced with other safes. Plus, the capacity to hold 25 guns made it perfect for my collection.

I must mention the fantastic fire protection offered by this safe, with 75 minutes of fire resistance. In case of emergencies, my most valuable possessions will be safe and sound. The factory-installed door storage panel and single electrical outlet kit are also fantastic additions that make organization and accessibility a breeze.

However, one thing that could be improved is the locking mechanism. The combination lock occasionally feels a bit finicky, but it hasn't caused any significant issues.

These minor inconveniences are far outweighed by the safe's overall performance and reliability.

In conclusion, the Liberty Safe's Colonial Series safe has been a game-changer for securing and organizing my firearms collection. The combination of features, security, and capacity make it a top choice for gun enthusiasts looking for a high-quality safe.
