### [13-Target Reversible Cardboard Shooting Range Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=13-target-reversible-cardboard-shooting-range-target)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=reversa-corrugated-target-1"><img alt="reversa-corrugated-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/reversa-corrugated-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently discovered the ReVersa premium quality corrugated target, and I must say it has become my go-to choice for shooting practice. The front of the target features 13 clear targets with ample spacing, making it easy to aim at from a distance. Not only does the backside accommodate up to 12 clay pigeons, but it also serves as a sturdy backer for other targets.

One of this product's strong points is its speedy setup; when combined with the ReVersa stands, you can have it ready to use in seconds! However, a potential drawback is that covering old holes with tape can be challenging - which limits its lifespan to roughly 3-5 uses based on round count.

Despite this minor issue, I still highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an efficient and versatile target option that doesn't compromise on quality or durability.

### [Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree: Multi-Target Steel Shooting Challenge](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-multi-target-steel-shooting-challenge)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1"><img alt="cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've been using Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree at my range and it's provided countless hours of fun and challenging gameplay. With a solid steel frame and 8 spring-loaded flip targets, this dueling tree is perfect for practicing my accuracy and having fun with friends.

The sizes range from 1.5" to 3", which makes for an interesting and varied game experience. I've found that the smaller targets require more precise aiming, while the larger ones are slightly easier to hit. With a wide base and stakes, it's extremely stable and stays in place even during our more intense shooting sessions.

One minor downside is that occasionally some of the paddles might get stuck halfway back or bounce back, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I just give them a gentle push to reset and continue my session.

The only real issue I've run into is that the springs connected to the paddles can sometimes feel a bit loose and flimsy. However, I discovered that applying a light coat of lubricant like WD-40 silicone spray resolved this issue.

Overall, I've been thoroughly impressed with Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree's quality, durability, and convenience. It's not only allowed me to improve my shooting skills but also provided a great way to bond with my friends during some intense target practice sessions. I'd definitely recommend investing in one of these dueling trees as it offers exceptional value for its price point and has undoubtedly enhanced my overall shooting experience.

### [Life-Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets - 19"x25" - 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=life-size-silhouette-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=red-fire-life-size-silhouette-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1"><img alt="red-fire-life-size-silhouette-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/red-fire-life-size-silhouette-paper-shooting-targets-19x25-100-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets, a 19"x25" pack of 100, are the perfect companions for your shooting sessions. As soon as I unpackaged them, I was blown away by how bright and colorful the bold high-contrast silhouette is. The neon red bullseyes make it incredibly easy to see even the tiniest dark bullet holes, making scoring a breeze.

A major highlight of these targets is their lifelike size - half-torso human silhouette, providing an authentic touch to your shooting practice. The scoring zones are thoughtfully designed, with each having a 1" bright-colored center for precise aiming. I also appreciated how each cylindrical scoring ring mirrors the ones found in standard 25-yard handgun qualifying targets, allowing me to incorporate these into my regular training routine.

One thing that sets these targets apart from others is their durability. Despite being made of paper, they held up quite well during multiple shooting sessions. The targets are easy to see from a distance, even in low light conditions, thanks to the bright white silhouette on a black background.

However, there's a minor downside. Although these targets are excellent for indoor use, their size may become challenging to manage in more cramped spaces. But overall, these Red-Fire Life Size Silhouette Paper Shooting Targets have given my practice sessions a boost of excitement and precision.

I recently picked up a pack of Daisy Red Ryder paper targets to use with my friend's new bb gun. The moment I saw the retro packaging, I knew I had to buy them! They're genuinely vintage-styled, and the Red Ryder theme is just perfect if you're fond of that classic Wild West aesthetic.

One thing that really stood out for me was the quality of the targets. They're made of sturdy cardboard that's tough enough to withstand a few hits. This pack comes with 25 assorted paper targets in different patterns, which were all a lot of fun to shoot at.

However, one downside to these targets is their size. They're quite small, so if you're looking for something larger, these might not be the best for you.

Overall, I had a great time using these paper targets from Daisy, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who's into target shooting or has a bb gun they want to practice with. Just be sure to check out the size before purchasing, as they might be a bit smaller than you expect.

I recently decided to upgrade my range practice with the Basic Training Silhouette target, and let me just say, it's been a game-changer for me. This life-size paper target is perfect for practicing on a variety of firearms, from pistols to rifles, at distances between 10 feet and 40 yards.

The first thing that caught my eye was the clear vital zones and scoring area, which made aiming and scoring much easier than with traditional targets. The extra aim points on either side of the head proved invaluable during my practice sessions, giving me more opportunities to hone my shot placements. Plus, the bold vital organ outlines provided consistent feedback that helped me understand how to effectively neutralize an assailant.

I also appreciated the fact that these targets are made in the U. S. A. , ensuring that I'm supporting a local business and getting a high-quality product at the same time. In addition, the reduced cost thanks to the 1-color printing on 60-pound bright white paper made this purchase an even better value.

Overall, the Basic Training Silhouette has been an excellent addition to my range gear. Although the durability may lead to it lasting forever, I have no complaints about the performance or functionality of this target. If you're in the market for an affordable and effective shooting target, this is definitely worth considering.

### [Bright Splatter Paper Shooting Targets Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=bright-splatter-paper-shooting-targets-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardboard-shooting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardboard-shooting-targets&utm_term=atflbox-25pcs-12-x-13-splatter-paper-shooting-targetand-adhesive-target-rective-shooting-targets-for-1"><img alt="atflbox-25pcs-12-x-13-splatter-paper-shooting-targetand-adhesive-target-rective-shooting-targets-for-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atflbox-25pcs-12-x-13-splatter-paper-shooting-targetand-adhesive-target-rective-shooting-targets-for-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Atflbox Splatter Paper Targets to sharpen my shooting skills, and they've been a game-changer. The instant visual feedback from the bright fluorescent yellow makes it super easy to see where my shots land from a distance, even outdoors. No more squinting to see whether I hit the mark or not. Plus, the adhesive makes attaching and reattaching these targets a breeze.

One thing I especially love about these splatter paper targets is that they stick easily and don't fall off, ensuring each shot hits the mark. However, the sheets are a bit on the thin side, so they may not hold up as well against heavy-duty rifles or pellet guns.

All in all, the Atflbox Splatter Paper Targets have been a solid addition to my shooting practice. The vibrant color and sticky back make them perfect for quick shootouts, whether you're training indoors or out in the field.

One drawback that I encountered was that, despite being made with high-quality materials, the paper used in these targets wasn't as durable as I would have liked. As a result, I found myself replacing the targets after only a few uses. However, the cost is quite reasonable considering that the product comes with two large targets, so this was not too much of a setback for me.

I recently got my hands on the Small DartBattle Target Cutouts, and they sure turned out to be a hit at my son's birthday party! These cardboard cutouts, shaped like targets, were so easy to set up and added a pop of color and excitement to our DIY Nerf obstacle course.

One of the first things that caught my eye about these targets was their size. At 20.5cm wide, they're just the right size for kids' parties without dominating the space. Plus, they're made of lightweight cardboard, which means they're easy to handle and attach wherever you want them - even the most challenging spots like windows and doors.

However, I did find a small inconvenience with these targets. Given that they're printed on one side only, it can be a bit difficult to position them perfectly if you want to stick them onto a plastic tablecloth for your DIY party decor.

But overall, these small dart battle target cutouts have been a fantastic addition to our kid's parties. They're versatile, colorful, and bring life into any play area.

Recently, I've begun incorporating the Allen Titan Cardboard Deer Target into my archery and rifle practice sessions, and I can't express how much of a difference it's made. Not only is it a life-size target that accurately portrays the shape of a deer, but the organ profiles have been incredibly helpful for honing my shot placement skills. The best part is that it's incredibly versatile - I've been using it in front of my current archery block or bag for a solid backstop, and it's held up surprisingly well.

One thing that really sets this target apart from others is the ease with which it can be adhered to a target stand at your range. It's been particularly useful when target practicing with a rifle, as it provides a realistic experience that mirrors actual hunting conditions.

However, not everything about this target is perfect. The cardboard can withstand multiple shots, but it does show signs of wear and tear over time. Additionally, some users have mentioned that the vital organ profiles could use more contrast to make them more easily visible.

I've been using the Champion LE Target Silhouette Cardboard for my shooting practice, and I must say, it's a game-changer! The high-definition printing makes the targets incredibly realistic, making every practice session feel like the real thing. Plus, the green color makes it very easy to identify where each shot lands, which is a major plus.

One of the things I love about this target is its scoring table. It's a brilliant feature that helps me keep track of my performance and rounds, giving me a clear idea of how I'm progressing. And let's not forget about the high-quality materials it's made from. They ensure durability, so I don't have to worry about replacing it too soon.

Although a few of the cheaper targets from my local store couldn't withstand more than a few volleys, this one impressively held up even after numerous shots.

The only minor inconvenience I experienced was the slightly flimsy cardboard packaging, which made it a bit challenging to transport. However, once set up, the target is robust and highly effective.
