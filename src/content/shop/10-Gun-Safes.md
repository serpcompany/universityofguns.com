### [Durable 57 Long Gun Safe with Anti-Pry System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="kodiak-kbx5940-57-long-gun-safe-with-safex-security-system-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kodiak-kbx5940-57-long-gun-safe-with-safex-security-system-1/public"/></a></div>

Over the past few months, I've been using the Kodiak KBX5940 57 Long Gun Safe, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The SafeX Security System is truly a game-changer, providing me with peace of mind knowing that my long guns are securely locked away with its anti-pry technology.

One of the most impressive features of this safe is its 40 minutes of fire protection at 1400° Felsius, along with the fireboard protection in its ceiling, walls, floor, and door. I experienced this first-hand when there was a small fire at my house – my long guns were perfectly fine and undamaged.

The heat-activated Palusol Fire door seal is also worth mentioning. Its ability to expand up to eight times its size helps keep heat and smoke out of the safe, which is excellent for preserving my valuable firearms.

As for security features, this safe comes with a UL listed electronic lock and is a CA DOJ certified firearm safety device. Additionally, the 14 gauge steel construction ensures that it's sturdy and durable.

However, there are few cons that come with this product. While the SafeX Security System is top-notch, the door's hinges could be better. They occasionally get stiff, making rotating the door difficult.

Also, although the external dimensions are perfect for my living room, the internal capacity might not be enough for some avid gun collectors. But for me, it holds up to 57 long guns, which suits my collection perfectly.

Overall, the Kodiak KBX5940 57 Long Gun Safe has truly been a game-changer in safeguarding my long guns. It offers incredible fire protection, robust security features, and is built with high-quality craftsmanship. While there are a few minor drawbacks, these are far outweighed by the many benefits.

### [10-Gun Locking Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="surelock-combat-10-gun-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-combat-10-gun-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got myself a Surelock Combat 10-Gun Cabinet, and I must say, it has been a game-changer in keeping my long guns organized and secure. This sturdy gun cabinet easily fits up to 10 long guns, leaving enough space for each gun. The steel body and door are strong, providing ample protection against any impact.

One thing that stood out was the ease of assembly. It arrived almost fully assembled, and setting it up was a breeze. The barrel rests and adjustable shelves inside make it easier to store various types of firearms. I also love its compact design, which doesn’t take up too much space in my room.

However, the lock could be more secure. The keyed lock, while functional, doesn't feel as durable as the rest of the cabinet. And, as with some other reviews, there have been minor denting issues right out of the box.

Overall, the Surelock Combat 10-Gun Cabinet is a decent choice for those looking for an affordable, compact, and secure way to store their long guns. While it isn't perfect, it definitely does its job well for most users. So, if you're in the market for a reliable gun cabinet, this one might be worth considering.

### [Stylish Fireproof 30-Gun Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Stack-On Elite 30-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock and Door Storage, and I must say, this little guy has been a game-changer in my house. As someone who owns quite a few firearms, I needed a secure and reliable place to store them. This safe has exceeded my expectations.

The first thing that stood out to me was its fire-resistant capability. The safe is rated to withstand temperatures up to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes, which is more than enough time to get out in case of a fire. Additionally, it boasts a drill-resistant hardened steel plate located behind the lock, providing extra security and peace of mind.

One of the most convenient features of this safe is its fully-adjustable interior. With three adjustable shelves and three adjustable-position barrel rests, I can store my long guns with ease, and the adjustability allows me to accommodate different firearm sizes. Plus, the door organizer with sewn-in holsters and pouches is perfect for keeping smaller items like ammunition and cleaning supplies organized and easily accessible.

The electronic lock is user-friendly and quick to set up. However, I appreciate that a backup key is included, just in case the battery dies or I need to bypass the lock for any reason. It's also worth mentioning that this safe is approved by the state of California as a Firearm Safety Device, meeting the requirements of Penal Code section 23655 and the regulations issued thereunder.

Now, onto the cons. One issue I encountered was the misleading capacity. While the safe is advertised to hold 30 guns, I was only able to fit around 20, especially if I wanted to store scoped rifles. Additionally, the provided shelves are not tall enough to accommodate longer firearms without the door hitting the stocks, so I had to customize one of the shelves to fit my needs better.

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Stack-On Elite 30-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock and Door Storage. Its sturdiness, storage options, and fire-resistant capabilities make it a worthy addition to any home or office. While there were a few minor issues, these are far outweighed by the safe's many highlights.

### [AMSEC NF6030E5 Secure 14-Gun Rifle and Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="amsec-nf6030e5-rifle-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/amsec-nf6030e5-rifle-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been utilizing the AMSEC NF6030 E5 Gun Safe to secure a number of valuable items, including my prized firearms. Now, I’ve always been somewhat skeptical when it comes to the safety and efficiency promises made by manufacturers, but I have to admit, this safe has exceeded my expectations.

The first feature of the safe that left me pleasantly surprised was its fire resistance. The advanced 2-stage dual fire seal, combined with the 90-minute fire rating at 1200°, provided a level of protection that I had previously only read about. Additionally, the interior temperature never rose beyond the 350° mark, proving the reliability of AMSEC's claims.

In terms of security, this gun safe certainly delivers. Not only is it a UL Residential Security Container and California DOJ approved, but it also boasts a robust construction. The door features a 1/4-inch steel plate, while the body is made from an 11-gauge solid steel plate, making it nearly impossible to penetrate. The door lock system, a combination of an AMSEC ESL5 electronic lock, a mechanical dial lock, and a doomsday redundant lock, provides an additional layer of protection, guaranteeing the utmost privacy for your valuables.

Another outstanding aspect of the AMSEC NF6030 is the user-friendly interior. The all-velour, all-in-one design, complete with back-cover, firewalls, and side shelves, maximizes your storage space. The included premium door organizer (PDO) adds to the convenience by allowing for quick access to essential items like passports, handguns, and important documents. Furthermore, the built-in AC power port with a removable external power cord is perfect for charging electronic devices or powering other appliances, making this safe incredibly versatile.

Although the AMSEC NF6030 E5 Gun Safe has proven to be a reliable and secure addition to my home, there are a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, due to its capacity, it can become quite heavy when filled with contents. Secondly, assembling the safe may require some assistance, as it can be quite cumbersome for a single person.

In conclusion, the AMSEC NF6030 E5 Gun Safe is an exceptional investment for anyone looking to secure their valuable possessions. Its robust construction, advanced fire protection features, and user-friendly interior design make it a top choice among similar products available on the market.

### [Durable 10-Gun Cabinet with Woodgrain Interior and Attractive Finish](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-910-10-gun-metal-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-910-10-gun-metal-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

The cabinet is designed to store rifles and shotguns securely, with a three-bolt locking mechanism that ensures my collection remains inaccessible to unauthorized individuals.

What I truly appreciate about this cabinet is its combination of style and security. The woodgrain accented interior, along with the gold accents and striping, add a touch of sophistication to any room. Moreover, the sleek black powder-coated finish gives the cabinet a polished appearance that complements any decor.

One of the highlights of the cabinet is its durability. The scratch-resistant finish has been holding up well against daily use, keeping my cabinet looking brand new. Additionally, the metal cabinet is designed to be wall-mounted, providing extra security to prevent unauthorized access.

However, there are some aspects of the cabinet that could be improved. The instructions provided were not particularly helpful, making the assembly process a bit challenging for some users. It would be beneficial for the manufacturer to provide clearer, more detailed instructions for future customers.

In terms of its overall appearance, the cabinet's design may not suit everyone's taste. Some users might find the gold accents and woodgrain interior to be too ornate or outdated. It would be helpful to have a wider variety of color options and interior designs to cater to different preferences.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the American Furniture Classics gun cabinet offers a secure and stylish solution for storing rifles and shotguns. Its durability, locking mechanism, and sleek appearance make it an attractive option for those looking to preserve their firearms safely and enhance the appearance of their living space.

## Buyer's Guide

Gun safes are an essential purchase for responsible firearm owners. They provide a secure storage solution for your firearms, keeping them out of reach of unauthorized users and protecting them from theft, damage, and exposure to elements like water or fire. However, with the variety of gun safes available in the market, choosing the right one for your needs can be overwhelming. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

### Size and Capacity

The first step in choosing a gun safe is determining the number and type of firearms you need to store. Consider not just your current collection but also any future additions you may make to your collection. Make sure to measure the dimensions of your largest firearm and leave some extra space for future purchases or modifications. Remember that gun safes come in a range of sizes, so choose one that suits your specific needs.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/10-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/10+Gun+Safes-2/public" alt="10 Gun Safes-2"></a></div>

### Construction and Durability

Look for a gun safe made from heavy-gauge steel with solid construction. Durable materials like steel provide better security and resistance to breaking or bending. Thicker walls and doors are also indicators of a well-built gun safe. Some high-quality safes even use fire-resistant materials or fireboard lining for additional protection against fire and heat.

### Security Features

A good gun safe should have multiple layers of security to deter unauthorized access. Consider a safe with a combination lock or electronic keypad, as well as a backup key for emergencies. Some models also feature advanced security features such as motion sensors or internal relockers to prevent forced entry. Remember that the more security features a gun safe has, the higher its price point will be.

### Ease of Use and Accessibility

You want a gun safe that is easy to open and close, especially during emergency situations. Choose a model with a user-friendly locking mechanism, such as a simple combination dial or an electronic keypad with backlit buttons for nighttime use. Additionally, look for a safe with adjustable shelving or racks to make organizing your firearms more convenient. This will help you quickly locate and access specific firearms when needed.

### Brand Reputation and Warranty

Before making a purchase, research the reputation of the gun safe manufacturer. Look for customer reviews and ratings to ensure that the brand is known for producing high-quality, reliable products. Also, check the warranty offered by the manufacturer, as this can indicate their confidence in the product's durability and performance.

### Price and Budget

Finally, consider your available budget when selecting a gun safe. Prices can vary widely depending on the size, quality, and features of the safe. While investing in a high-quality gun safe is essential, it's important to balance cost with your specific needs and preferences. Don't forget that purchasing a gun safe is a long-term investment in the safety and security of your firearms and your family.
