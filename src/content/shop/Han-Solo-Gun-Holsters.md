### [Custom Comfort Flex Holster for S&W M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield. This holster is designed to be worn inside the waistband, providing both concealment and comfort. It's been a game-changer for me in terms of carrying my firearm discreetly and comfortably.

The highlight of this holster for me is the custom molded polymer front. It's specifically shaped to fit my weapon perfectly, ensuring a secure fit and easy draw. Another standout feature is the closed-cell foam padding that keeps the weapon away from my body, preventing any discomfort or sweat buildup.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the holster tends to scratch the slide of my gun. It's not a deal breaker, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be concerned about maintaining the condition of their firearms.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster. It provides excellent concealment and comfort, making it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their firearm discreetly and securely.

### [Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 W Light Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-p320c-m18-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon holster and I've been using it with my P320C/M18 light-bearing handgun. The first thing that caught my attention was its sleek, modern design. It's made of polymer, which gives it a solid feel without adding unnecessary weight.

One of the highlights for me is its ambidextrous configuration. Whether I'm wearing it as an inside-the-waistband (IWB) or outside-the-waistband (OWB), this holster adapts seamlessly. It's optimized for appendix carry, which is my preferred method of concealed carry, and it even comes with an appendix carry wing for extra concealment.

Another feature that I appreciate is the holster's compatibility with compact lights. As someone who often trains in low-light conditions, this is a must-have feature for me. Additionally, the optic cut accommodates most optics except for the SRO, making it versatile for various gun setups.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The belt clips and hardware were missing from my package, making the holster unusable until I can get those components. Additionally, the retention is quite tight even when the screws are loosened. This can make drawing the firearm more challenging than I'd like.

Despite these cons, I'm overall pleased with the Alien Gear Photon holster. Its build quality is impressive, and its versatility and adaptability make it a useful addition to my collection of concealed carry holsters.

### [Alienware Gun Holster - Ambidextrous IWB/OWB](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-optics-ready-holster-sig-p320f-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster, and I must say, it's definitely an interesting piece of equipment. Its ambidextrous design means you can switch the belt clip to either side, which makes it really versatile for different types of wear.

One thing I really liked about this holster is its ability to be worn either inside or outside the waistband. The polymer design feels rugged and strong, yet it's comfortable to wear all day. Plus, it can accommodate optics that don't stick out past the ejection port, which is a nice touch.

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the clip and claw configuration, finding it challenging to attach swiftly due to the design. Additionally, while the modularity of the holster is appreciated, some feel that it may not be the best option for advanced shooters as they seek more specialized holsters.

In terms of user reviews, the majority seem quite satisfied with the Alien Gear Photon, giving it high praise for its versatility and adjustability. However, there are also those who reported discomfort and disappointment with its functionality compared to other offerings on the market.

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon IWB - OWB Non-Light Holster offers a decent balance of features and flexibility for those in search of an affordable, comfortable gun holster. Just be aware that there may be some challenges in attachment and fine-tuning, particularly for more experienced shooters.

### [Alien Gear Canted IWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0203-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0203-r1-rh-150-d-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who carries concealed daily, having a reliable and comfortable holster is essential. The hard injection-molded shell adds an extra layer of durability, which is always a plus in my book.

One of the things I appreciated most about this holster is its versatility. It can be worn for both strong-side and appendix carry, which means it caters to different preferences and situations. There's also the adjustable canted grip angle and ride height, allowing me to customize the fit to my liking.

However, there were some cons to consider with the Roswell IWB Holster. Firstly, the holster doesn't fit P365XL/MRDS as advertised. This was disappointing, as I had specifically chosen this holster based on the claims made regarding its compatibility with these models. Secondly, there was an issue with suppressor-height sights, as they tended to jam the firearm inside the holster due to lack of clearance.

Despite these drawbacks, I still believe the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster is worth considering for those in search of a dependable and comfortable holster for their everyday carry needs.

### [Ambidextrous IWB Mossberg MC2C Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Desantis Gunhole Slim-TUK IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous, and I must say, it's an interesting piece of equipment. The minimalistic design appealed to me initially, but what really stands out is the adjustable tension and rugged 1.75-inch nylon clip that comes with it.

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the tuck-able 360 C-clip, as it provides me with numerous mounting options, making it versatile in various situations. Another notable thing about this IWB holster is the hardware that can be easily flipped to change from right to left-hand orientation for ambidextrous usage.

However, there are certain downsides too. It lacks a certain level of fit for my Mossberg MC2C, which could be a significant issue. Furthermore, the design isn't perfect; the gap between the barrel and the end of the holster is somewhat frustrating.

Overall, this holster offers some unique benefits but also has its limitations. It could be a good choice for those looking for a minimalistic and versatile IWB holster, but I would recommend trying it out with your gun first before making a purchase decision.

### [Adjustable Vertical Molle Tactical Pistol Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-outdoor-horizontal-molle-tactical-pistol-holster-hc-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Condor Outdoor Horizontal Molle Tactical Pistol Holster HC, and I have to say, it's been quite the experience using it. Made of high-quality nylon, this adjustable holster provides secure storage for different pistol models. Its wide, lightly padded flap is protected with a large Hook and Loop closure, along with a unique retention system that ensures the pistol stays solidly in place.

Now, speaking from personal use, the first thing that really stood out to me about this holster was its capacity to accommodate a wide range of pistol models. I loved how it could handle not only my smaller Springfield Hellcat Pro but also my bigger, 1911-sized weapons. However, I must admit there were some minor drawbacks.

For instance, the holster was made to fit a wide array of pistols, but it seemed more suited to larger handguns. Even after adjusting the internal strap to change the depth at which the pistol rides, I found that both my Glock 23 and CZ P-07 pistols sat too deeply into the holster. I believe a full-sized 1911 or P226 would fit better.

Another issue I encountered was the cumbersome design of the retention strap. If you need to rapidly deploy your pistol, you might find it difficult. The way it connects and wraps behind the beavertail is just too complicated for quick and easy release.

Lastly, the one MOLLE strap mounting option limits the ways you can wear this holster; it takes up the entire Velcro chest panel. This can be inconvenient if you'd like to mount any other accessory.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I found the Condor Outdoor Holster HC to be a very high-quality product. Its adjustability and strong material are definite pluses. If you're in the market for a reliable, adjustable tactical pistol holster, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.

### [Rapid Release Holster for Sig Sauer Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="bulldog-rapid-release-holster-sig-sauer-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-rapid-release-holster-sig-sauer-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Bulldog Rapid Release Holster, I was excited to see how it would perform. The first thing that caught my eye was the high-quality polymer construction that made it look and feel durable. When I tried fitting my Sig Sauer P320 into it, I was pleasantly surprised by how snug and secure the fit was. The adjustable draw positioning allowed me to find the perfect position that worked best for me, and the quick-draw release feature made it a breeze to access my firearm when needed.

One thing that impressed me about this holster was its safety features. The locking mechanism provided a secure Level II retention, ensuring that my firearm stayed safely in place until I needed to access it. The one-finger quick-draw release made it easy to disengage the lock without fumbling or struggling. Overall, the Bulldog Rapid Release Holster with Paddle has been a reliable companion that gives me peace of mind when it comes to my personal safety.

However, there were a few cons that I couldn't overlook. The paddle was quite difficult to attach and remove from my belt, making it a bit inconvenient at times. Additionally, I noticed that the holster doesn't provide as much coverage as I initially thought it would, which means that my weapon is more visible when I'm wearing it.

Despite these minor issues, I believe that the Bulldog Rapid Release Holster with Paddle is an excellent choice for anyone who needs quick and easy access to their firearm. Its adjustable draw positioning, secure locking mechanism, and quick-draw release make it stand out from the competition. If you're in the market for a high-quality holster, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-1006-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-1006-r1-rh-150-d-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB holster, and it's been quite a game-changer for my everyday carry needs. This holster boasts an injection-molded shell that's harder than traditional Kydex, making it incredibly durable. It's designed for both strong-side and appendix carry options, which is great for those who prioritize versatility in their concealed carry choice.

One of the standout features of the Roswell is its adjustable canted grip angle and ride height on your belt. This means you can customize the holster to fit your personal comfort level and drawing style. Additionally, a carry claw and muzzle wedge are included, providing added stability and concealment.

However, there were some issues with this holster as well. For instance, it didn't fit my P365XL with an MRDS as advertised, causing some misalignment issues. Also, the clearance for suppressor-height sights wasn't ideal, leading to minor jamming issues. Overall, while there are some pros to this holster, it may not be the perfect choice for everyone, especially those looking for optimal compatibility with various firearm configurations.

As a daily carry user, I appreciated its ability to provide all the performance and reliability of a full-size holster while remaining discreet and comfortable. The minimalist design allows for a perfect fit for my P365XL, and the adjustable retention system ensures a smooth and secure draw every time.

One of the standout features for me is the claw, which helps minimize the grip's print by pressing it against my side. This is especially important when I'm in situations where concealment is crucial. However, I did find that the belt clip can be a bit finicky at times, and it takes some getting used to.

Overall, I've found the Mission First Tactical Minimalist IWB Holster to be an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable holster for their P365XL. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the overall performance and concealment capabilities make this an ideal solution for daily carry.

The low profile design blends seamlessly with my usual attire, making it perfect for daily use. I particularly appreciated the adjustable retention and the fact that it accommodates both right & left-hand positioning.

However, one downside I experienced was the initial difficulty in adjusting the retention mechanism - it took a bit of trial and error to get it right. Additionally, while I found the tuckable belt clip convenient, it did loosen up over time and needed re-tightening occasionally.

Nonetheless, overall, this holster offers a secure and comfortable way to carry my P365XL, making it an essential part of my everyday carry.

### [IWB Tactical Holster for Sig Sauer P320/M17/P320c/M18 with TLR1/HL](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/han-solo-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

What sets this holster apart is its compatibility with various models such as the P320, M17, P320c, and M18 TLR1/HL right hand black. Its ability to fit all quickship models and the wide range of weapon lights it accommodates is impressive. More than just fitting the standard RMR/Red Dots on the market, it also holds up well with larger sights without compromising comfort or concealment.

The wedge feature adds an extra layer of convenience. It optimizes deployment and ensures complete comfort while wearing it. I also appreciate how the tall sight channel accommodates both Red Dot and Suppressor heights with ease.

One negative aspect, however, is that the holster requires a little extra effort when removing it from my pants. But this slightly increased difficulty also provides better security for my Sig, which I consider a worthwhile trade-off.

This holster is not only precise but also 100% made in America by veterans and law enforcement personnel, backed by a lifetime guarantee. Its solid locking retention system provides a satisfying click when the weapon is securely tucked away.

All things considered, the C&G Holsters Alpha IWB Tactical Holster offers a perfect blend of comfort, style, and functionality.
