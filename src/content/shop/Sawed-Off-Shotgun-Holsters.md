### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Airsoft Gun T Holster (Thumb Release Button Holster) - Military Polymer Material](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=airsoft-gun-t-holster-thumb-release-button-holster-military-polymer-material)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=mega-fit-t-holsterthumb-release-button-holster-fits-most-popular-full-size-and-compact-semi-automati-1"><img alt="mega-fit-t-holsterthumb-release-button-holster-fits-most-popular-full-size-and-compact-semi-automati-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mega-fit-t-holsterthumb-release-button-holster-fits-most-popular-full-size-and-compact-semi-automati-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Mega-Fit T Holster for several weeks now, and I'm genuinely impressed with its compatibility and design. This holster fits a variety of popular full-size and compact semi-automatic pistols, making it versatile for different uses. While it's optimal for guns with 4.5" barrels, it can accommodate 4" to 5" barrel lengths too. The open bottom supports longer barrels, ensuring secure retention of your weapon.

Made from military polymer material, the holster is easy to clean and maintain. Its internal design is simplified yet effective, and the protruding button is simple to touch. A skidproof strip helps you identify the holster through your sense of touch.

I find the Mega-Fit T Holster perfect for various purposes such as military, civilian, shooting coach, law enforcement, and personal protection use. Its adjustability and retention capabilities make it a reliable choice for all these roles. However, I did experience a slightly finicky thumb release button that occasionally gets stuck if not pushed properly.

While this holster is a little bulky, its quality and performance make up for it. Overall, I highly recommend the Mega-Fit T Holster if you're seeking an adaptable and reliable holster for your handgun.

### [Covert MOD1 OWB Kydex Holster for FN FN509 RH](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=covert-mod1-owb-kydex-holster-for-fn-fn509-rh)

I recently got the chance to try out the C&G Holsters Mod 1, an OWB Covert FN FN509 RH holster, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. This holster has a solid locking retention system that gives an audible and tactile "click" when securely holstered. That's music to my ears!

One of the features that really stands out is its adjustable tension. It's perfect for those days when you need a little extra hold or when I want to go light. Another highlight is the extra tall sight channels, which ensures that it easily accommodates my suppressor sights.

However, there's one thing I found a little difficult - removing it. While the patent-pending hinge system conforms well with my body movements, it can get a bit tricky when I'm trying to unholster my firearm. But hey, practice makes perfect, right?

All in all, I'm really happy with my purchase. It's durable, well-made, and best of all, it fits my FN 509 like a glove. And that's not all, the team at C&G Holsters are super responsive and helpful. They make the holster buying process a smooth and easy ride.

I would highly recommend the C&G Holsters Mod 1 for anyone in the market for an OWB Covert FN FN509 RH holster. Despite the minor inconvenience of removing the holster, which I'm sure I'll master in no time, it's definitely worth the investment.

I've been using the Galco Sao Single Action Outdoorsman Holster to carry my Ruger Blackhawk 45 long colt in the field for hunting, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. The ability to wear it strong side or crossdraw gives me the flexibility I need depending on the situation. I appreciate the retention strap that ensures my revolver stays in place even in dense brush. Plus, the tension screw adjustments allow me to customize the fit to my specific weapon.

One of the best features of this holster is its premium saddle leather construction, which not only looks great but also feels incredibly comfortable and secure. It fits belts up to 1 3/4" and is specifically designed for single-action revolvers - perfect for my needs.

However, one downside I encountered was the slightly tricky installation process, which took me a bit of time to figure out. But once installed, it's been performing flawlessly and has given me peace of mind in various outdoor situations. Overall, this is an excellent choice for anyone looking to confidently carry their single-action revolver in the field.

### [Galco Gunleather Switchback Strongside/Crossdraw Belt Holster for X-frame 6.5" Revolver](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=galco-gunleather-switchback-strongsidecrossdraw-belt-holster-for-x-frame-65-revolver)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=galco-gunleather-switchback-strongside-crossdraw-belt-holster-1"><img alt="galco-gunleather-switchback-strongside-crossdraw-belt-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-gunleather-switchback-strongside-crossdraw-belt-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Galco Gunleather Switchback Strongside/Crossdraw Belt Holster, I must say it's been an unbeatable companion for my revolver. The craftsmanship is evident in every stitch, with the blend of synthetic materials and leather giving it durability and style. The ambidextrous design makes it perfect for both strongside and crossdraw positions, while the reversible safety strap adds a layer of security. However, it does take some getting used to the tight fit, as it requires a break-in period for the leather to mold around my particular firearm. Overall, the Galco Gunleather Switchback is a reliable choice for those looking for a sturdy and secure holster solution.

The use of layered synthetics, including an outer layer of black ballistic nylon and a lining of 420 denier gunmetal-colored packcloth, provides durability and adds to the overall aesthetic of the holster. Additionally, the exoskeleton made of top grain steer hide is a great touch, as it allows for both strongside and crossdraw positioning options. The safety strap is also a welcome feature, offering a secure hold while still being reversible for ambidextrous use.

However, the tight fit of the Galco Gunleather Switchback does require a break-in period, which may be a point of contention for some users. It might take a bit of time for the leather to mold around the individual contours of the firearm, but it's worth the wait for the improved fit and comfort.

In conclusion, the Galco Gunleather Switchback Strongside/Crossdraw Belt Holster serves as a reliable and secure option for those in need of a versatile holster solution. The combination of durable materials and thoughtful design make it a strong contender in the market, despite the initial stiffness that users may experience.

First things first, this holster is as durable as it gets. Constructed from premium saddle leather, it's designed to withstand even the toughest of conditions. Its tan color and smooth finish give it a classic aesthetic that feels right at home in the great outdoors.

One of my favorite features about this holster is its adjustability. The tension screw allows me to customize how snugly my gun fits in the holster. Plus, whether you prefer wearing it strong side or crossdraw, this versatile holster has got you covered.

However, one thing you should keep in mind is that this holster is not compatible with optics. So if you're planning to accessorize your revolver, this might not be the perfect fit for you.

### [Dual-Purpose Reversible Kodra Sidekick Holster, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sawed-off-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sawed-off-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=dual-purpose-reversible-kodra-sidekick-holster-black)

I remember the day I first got my hands on this Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Sidekick Holster. It was a hot summer day, and I was looking for a holster that could handle both the heat and the wear and tear of daily use. As soon as I slipped it on, I knew I had found something special.

This holster is not only durable and tough but also features a patented Kodra laminate with a padded, waterproof interior. This kept my firearm snug and secure, no matter how active I got throughout the day. Plus, the spring steel belt clip is powder-coated for corrosion resistance, ensuring that this holster will last me a lifetime.

One of the standout features for me is the reversible belt clip. This means I can wear it outside of my pants or opt for a more discreet inside-the-waistband carry. The non-stretch hook & loop retention strap and molded thumb break provide added security, making sure my firearm stays firmly in place no matter what.

However, there have been some minor issues. The strap, although sturdy, doesn't seem to be repairable, so if it were to break, I would need to replace the entire holster. Additionally, it didn't fit my Walther P99 as advertised, which disappointed me.

Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Kodra Sidekick Holster. It's comfortable, reliable, and versatile, making it a perfect choice for both on- and off-duty situations.

One of the things that really sold me on this holster was its unique design. It's got a nylon outer shell that's super lightweight and comfortable, but also tough enough to handle the wear and tear of daily use.

Another thing I love about this holster is its versatility. it's adjustable and can be worn on either side, so I can switch it up depending on what I'm wearing or if I need to be more discreet. And the offside tie-down feature is a nice touch that helps keep my gun secure and in place.

That said, there are a few things that could be improved. For one, the strapping material is a bit stiff, which can be a little uncomfortable at times. And while the unique design is a plus in some ways, it can also be a little confusing to figure out at first.

But overall, I've been really happy with this holster. It's comfortable, concealable, and made from high-quality materials that have held up well over time. If you're looking for a reliable and versatile shoulder holster, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.

One of the highlights of this product is its adjustable straps. I found them very helpful, especially when it came to getting the right fit. Another nice feature is its adjustable retention strap which keeps your firearm in place firmly yet comfortably.

However, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I did struggle with the fact that the straps are not adjustable enough, causing some discomfort during long hours of use. Additionally, I noticed that the holster tends to slide down my leg, which can be quite inconvenient.

All in all, if you're looking for a holster that offers good concealment and comfort, Uncle Mike's Kodra Nylon Ankle Holster might just be what you need. Just remember to keep an eye on those straps!
