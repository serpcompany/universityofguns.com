### [G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack - Gray](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="g-outdoors-handgunner-backpack-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/g-outdoors-handgunner-backpack-gray-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got the G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack in gray, I couldn't believe how much it could hold. This backpack is designed to transport 4 handguns, ammo, shooting glasses, ear protection, targets, stapler, binos, and cleaning supplies. The most unique feature is the inside Storage Cradle that slides in and out of the lower compartment. It's perfect for cleaning or storing the handguns in your safe.

The Visual I. D. storage system is another thoughtful feature. It helps me organize my gear easily. The twin side pockets are a great addition to store extra magazines, making it easy to access my supplies while shooting. I also love the pull-out waterproof cover that helps keep my belongings dry in case of sudden rain.

However, I wish there was a dedicated pocket for ammo. It's a little inconvenient not having a designated spot for it. Overall, this backpack is well-made with lockable heavy-duty zippers that provide added security. The color is neutral and blends well with my other shooting gear.

In terms of capacity, this backpack has plenty of room for a whole day at the range. It even has a spot where I can attach my first aid kit. The straps are easy to hide when not in use, making it convenient when rolling the bag on wheels instead of carrying it.

Based on my experience, I would highly recommend the G Outdoors Handgunner Backpack to anyone who needs a durable and spacious backpack for their handguns and shooting gear. It's perfect for both men and women who enjoy spending time at the range.

### [Safariland 7378 ALS Concealment Holster with Paddle and Belt Loop](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-model-7378-7ts-als-concealment-paddle-and-belt-loop-combo-holster-7378-8327-413" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-7378-7ts-als-concealment-paddle-and-belt-loop-combo-holster-7378-8327-413/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster, I was immediately impressed by its sleek design and sturdy construction. As a connoisseur of holsters, I must say that this one stands out from the rest in both quality and durability.

The first thing that caught my eye was the ALS (Automatic Locking System) feature. It's designed to secure your weapon automatically as it's holstered but still allows for a fast, natural draw with just the swipe of your thumb. This is perfect for those situations where you need access to your weapon in a matter of seconds.

The holster's material - SafariSeven non-marking nylon blend - is another highlight. It's not only durable and weather-resistant but also non-abrasive, ensuring that your firearm's finish remains intact. Plus, its raised interior stand-offs allow dirt and moisture to clear quickly, making it suitable for all conditions.

However, there are a few cons to consider. Some users mentioned that despite being advertised as a concealment holster, it may not be ideal for everyone due to its size and retention system design. It could potentially stick out from your body, making concealment difficult unless you're wearing baggy clothes.

Another potential downside is the holster's thickness, which might make it uncomfortable to wear if you're not used to it. Some users reported getting pinched or bruised while wearing it under their t-shirts.

In conclusion, the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster is an excellent choice for those looking for a high-quality, secure, and convenient holster. Its ALS feature provides peace of mind while its durable nylon-blend material ensures longevity. While it may not be perfect for everyone, especially in terms of concealment and comfort, it's definitely worth considering if you prioritize safety and quick access to your weapon.

### [Tactical LV M4 Shorty - Backpack Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="5-11-tactical-lv-m4-shorty-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-11-tactical-lv-m4-shorty-black-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid tactical enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for versatile gear that can adapt to my ever-changing needs. That's why I was thrilled to discover the 5.11 Tactical LV M4 Shorty Black. This little powerhouse has become my go-to bag for transporting up to a 29-inch rifle with ease.

The beauty of this product lies in its padded shoulder straps that ingeniously convert from backpack to crossbody mode. The Grab handles make it incredibly easy to maneuver, while the 840D Nylon material ensures durability and resilience. Its signature Centerline design boasts a discrete/tuckable logo, adding a touch of stealth to its appearance.

One notable feature I appreciate is the front compartment, which comes equipped with a laser-cut loop panel and an internal mesh pocket for optimal organization. This bag truly shines in terms of capacity and comfort, making it perfect for those who demand functionality without sacrificing style.

However, the LV M4 Shorty Black does come with a minor con - its limited visual appeal. While the design is undeniably sleek and streamlined, it may not cater to those who prefer more flamboyant or eye-catching options. But overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking a reliable and adaptable tactical backpack.

### [Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="outdoor-connection-sling-backpack-talon-swivels-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/outdoor-connection-sling-backpack-talon-swivels-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to test out the Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling and it's become an essential part of my hunting gear. As a passionate hunter, I've always struggled with the hassle of carrying my rifle while keeping both hands free. This sling is designed with convenience in mind, allowing me to confidently secure my firearm on my back, leaving my hands free to focus on the hunting experience.

One of the features that stood out for me was the use of superior quality Talon swivels. They provide a lifetime of use, giving me the peace of mind knowing that my rifle is secure during my hunts. Additionally, the sling easily converts to a standard carry, giving me flexibility in how I transport my firearm.

However, I also noticed a few areas where the Outdoor Connection Backpack Rifle Sling could improve. Some users reported issues with the strap tensioners and connectors, which could be a potential concern for long-term use.

In conclusion, after using this sling quite a bit, I can genuinely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their rifle while hunting. It's a fantastic addition to my gear, and I'm excited to keep using it on my upcoming adventures.

### [Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack: Comfortable and Durable Laptop Backpack with Gun Scabbard](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="eberlestock-gunslinger-ii-pack-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eberlestock-gunslinger-ii-pack-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack Backpack, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! This medium-sized military backpack has been my go-to ever since I got it. The highlight features for me are its spacious design, adjustable compartments, and overall comfort.

The Gunslinger II has full-width circumference which provides excellent protection for your items, particularly important if you're carrying gear or weapons. Its ability to be both adjustable and versatile has made it a favorite in my collection. The main bag is roomy, yet it can also be cinched down to fit any smaller needs.

One of the coolest features I've found is the rifle scabbard. I was amazed at how well it held my weapon, keeping it safe and secure while I went about my day. The scabbard is also perfect for storing anything else you might need, from your lunch to extra ammo.

Despite all these great features, there are a few minor drawbacks. Firstly, the Eberlestock could benefit from incorporating some easy access helmet holder or slot for quick snacks and essentials. Additionally, although the Intex-II frame system offers good support, it might not suit everyone's needs and may require adjustments or replacements in some cases.

In conclusion, the Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack Backpack is a top-tier military-grade backpack that is versatile, comfortable, and well-designed. Whether you're in the military, police force, or just someone who appreciates high-quality gear, you'll surely appreciate what this bag has to offer.

### [Safariland Model 7378 ALS Hellcat Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/backpack-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-sl-7378-als-hellcat-blk-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter who's always on the lookout for the perfect holster, I can't tell you how much I've come to rely on the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster. It's not just another piece of gear; it's a game-changer in terms of convenience and reliability.

This holster surprised me with its robust combination of features. The automatic locking system (ALS) instantly secures your weapon when you holster it, giving you peace of mind knowing your firearm is safely tucked away. But when it comes time to draw, the ALS release is a breeze to deactivate, allowing for a swift and natural draw - an excellent balance between safety and speed.

I also appreciate its open-top design without the SLS (Self-Locking System). It's quick and easy to retrieve your weapon without any unnecessary fumbling around. And the SafariSeven construction? It's brilliant. This proprietary nylon blend is not only incredibly durable but also completely non-abrasive to your firearm's finish. Plus, it boasts remarkable heat and cold tolerance, making it structurally sound from 300°F to -50°F.

The adjustable belt loop is another highlight. It's perfect for customizing your draw angle and accommodating different carrying positions. Even better, it's so comfortable to wear that I often forget I'm packing.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The sleek design can make gripping the holster a bit challenging when removing it from your belt. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure the release button is fully engaged, or the ALS might inadvertently secure your weapon while attempting to draw.

Overall, the Safariland Model 7378 7TS Holster has become an indispensable part of my shooting arsenal. It's reliable, versatile, and incredibly comfortable to wear. Highly recommended!
