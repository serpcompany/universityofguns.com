As a firearms instructor, I recently had the opportunity to test the Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster with my Sig P320C / M18. The holster's auto-locking, toolless design made it extremely easy to switch between OWB and IWB carry without any hassle. And the ambidextrous design ensured that both left and right-handed shooters could easily use it.

One of my favorite aspects of this holster is its high-strength, heat-resistant polymer construction which allowed for a superior fit for my Sig P320C / M18. The slim design also helped to conceal what matters most by sitting closer to my body than ever before. This minimized printing and ensured that my firearm stayed in place as intended while naturally moving with my body.

The Blade-Tech Total Eclipse 2. 0 IWB/OWB Modular Holster for Smith & Wesson Shield 9/40/Plus is an innovative product that offers a versatile and reliable experience. The auto-locking, toolless design with Mod-Lok makes it easy to transition from OWB to IWB carry, and the modular adaptability allows you to choose quick-release Mods that fit your individual needs. It's also great to have the ambidextrous holster design as it accommodates both left and right-handed shooters.

One of the particularly impressive features is the positive lock trigger guard which provides tactile feedback, ensuring that the firearm remains secure at all times. However, there is one thing that I would like to see improved in future iterations - metal belt clips instead of plastic construction. While they are currently durable through various means, they may eventually fail or break over time.

Overall, this holster earns an A++ for its durability and versatility. Finding a holster that meets these criteria can be challenging, but Blade-Tech manages to deliver with their Total Eclipse 2. 0 Holster for S&W Shield 9/40/Plus.

It offers just enough retention to hold my gun in place without being overly tight, providing peace of mind while carrying. Another great feature is the customizable fit - thanks to its adjustable options which allows me to carry my pistol comfortably whether sitting or standing.
