### [Stylish Fireproof 30-Gun Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stack-on-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=stack-on-gun-safes&utm_term=stylish-fireproof-30-gun-safe-with-electronic-lock)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stack-on-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=stack-on-gun-safes&utm_term=stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1"><img alt="stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-elite-27-30-gun-safe-electronic-lock-matte-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Stack-On Elite 30-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock and Door Storage, and I must say, this little guy has been a game-changer in my house. As someone who owns quite a few firearms, I needed a secure and reliable place to store them. This safe has exceeded my expectations.

The first thing that stood out to me was its fire-resistant capability. The safe is rated to withstand temperatures up to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes, which is more than enough time to get out in case of a fire. Additionally, it boasts a drill-resistant hardened steel plate located behind the lock, providing extra security and peace of mind.

One of the most convenient features of this safe is its fully-adjustable interior. With three adjustable shelves and three adjustable-position barrel rests, I can store my long guns with ease, and the adjustability allows me to accommodate different firearm sizes. Plus, the door organizer with sewn-in holsters and pouches is perfect for keeping smaller items like ammunition and cleaning supplies organized and easily accessible.

The electronic lock is user-friendly and quick to set up. However, I appreciate that a backup key is included, just in case the battery dies or I need to bypass the lock for any reason. It's also worth mentioning that this safe is approved by the state of California as a Firearm Safety Device, meeting the requirements of Penal Code section 23655 and the regulations issued thereunder.

Now, onto the cons. One issue I encountered was the misleading capacity. While the safe is advertised to hold 30 guns, I was only able to fit around 20, especially if I wanted to store scoped rifles. Additionally, the provided shelves are not tall enough to accommodate longer firearms without the door hitting the stocks, so I had to customize one of the shelves to fit my needs better.

Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Stack-On Elite 30-Gun Fireproof Safe with Electronic Lock and Door Storage. Its sturdiness, storage options, and fire-resistant capabilities make it a worthy addition to any home or office. While there were a few minor issues, these are far outweighed by the safe's many highlights.

As a first-timer when it comes to gun safes, I took the plunge and got myself the Stack-On Armorguard 40-Gun Safe. I've heard all the horror stories about cheap, low-quality gun safes, but I must admit, the Stack-On has blown me away in the best way possible.

First things first, the build quality is exceptional. The matte black exterior with chrome accents blends perfectly with the rest of my room's decor. It's like having a secret, stylish fortress for my collection.

One of the standout features of this safe is the backlit, electronic lock. I can easily set up a personalized code that even I won't forget! Gone are the days of fumbling around in the dark trying to find the right combination. Plus, the batteries are super easy to access, so there's no need to fret about changing them.

In terms of storage, I'm thrilled with the flexibility this safe offers. The single partition allows me to configure it to store both guns and important documents. I also love having adjustable barrel rests, which are perfect for storing my ARs, MSRs, and long guns.

The door is just as impressive, with sewn-in pockets for storing extra ammo or handguns. And the MOLLE strips? They're definitely a lifesaver when it comes to organizing my accessories. I've even thrown in a dehumidifier to keep everything nice and dry.

However, I did run into a couple of minor issues. The locking mechanism, while secure, is a little tricky to set up. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but now it's flawless.

Also, the included door organizer could use a couple more handgun holsters. But hey, that's what DIY projects are for.

In conclusion, I'm absolutely over the moon with my Stack-On Armorguard 40-Gun Safe. It's not only a fantastic addition to my home security, but it also looks super cool to boot. Highly recommended!

I recently invested in the Stack-On Armorguard 18 Gun Safe, hoping to keep my firearms protected and out of reach from my curious five-year-old. To my delight, it lived up to its hype as a reliable and affordable safe.

From the beginning, I was impressed by the safe's robust construction, particularly how well-insulated it is against fire. The electronic lock was also a highlight, providing both a secure passcode feature and a backup key for emergencies.

One of the best features was its 2-way door locking system, giving me peace of mind knowing that no unwelcome hands would pry my possessions away. Additionally, the adjustable shelves and door organizer proved incredibly useful in maximizing storage space within the safe.

However, there were some minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The safe itself is quite heavy, making relocation a two-person job. Also, I found the locking mechanism's battery compartment difficult to access, requiring me to disassemble parts of the safe each time I needed to replace them.

Despite these minor issues, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Armorguard 18 Gun Safe has exceeded my expectations, providing both ample security and convenience for storing my firearms. If you're seeking an affordable solution for firearm security, I would highly recommend giving this safe a shot.

As someone who values privacy and security, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product performed. The solid-steel door and pry-resistant hinges gave me peace of mind knowing my belongings were safe from potential thieves.

One of the features that stood out was the programmable electronic lock. It's not only convenient but also adds an extra layer of security by allowing me to set a unique code. Additionally, the two backup keys provided me with a failsafe in case I ever forget the code or need to share access with someone else.

Customization was another highlight for me. The adjustable shelves allowed me to store items in various sizes and shapes comfortably. Plus, the padded shelves and bottom foam helped protect my belongings from scratches and scuffs.

On the downside, the low-light LED feature wasn't as effective as I had hoped. It doesn't provide much illumination when the safe is opened, making it difficult to find smaller items inside.

In conclusion, the Stack-On Super-Sized Personal Safe proved to be a reliable and secure option for storing my valuables at home. Its sturdy construction, customizable storage, and easy-to-use electronic lock made it a worthwhile investment. However, the lackluster LED light could use some improvement.

However, there are a few cons worth mentioning. Assembling the cabinet can be a bit challenging, especially when installing the shelves. Ensuring that both shelves are in place before securing them is crucial to prevent any issues with fitting. Additionally, the cabinet's construction feels slightly less sturdy compared to other similar products on the market, which might lead to some sagging over time.

In conclusion, the Stack-On Pistol and Ammo Security Cabinet offers a solid option for those looking to store their handguns and ammo securely. Its well-made design, ample storage, and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment. Although there are some minor flaws, such as the assembly process and shelf installation, these do not outweigh the cabinet's overall performance and functionality.
