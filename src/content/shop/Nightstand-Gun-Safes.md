### [High-Capacity Biometric Gun Safe with Two Layers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rpnb-gun-safe-high-capacity-multifunction-pistol-safe-with-biometric-fingerprint-double-layer-quick--1/public"/></a></div>

Having tested this high-capacity gun safe, I can confirm it's a great option for securing firearms at home. The two separate layers provide ample storage space, ideal for sharing with family members without compromising privacy. The biometric fingerprint lock adds extra security and peace of mind. Setting up the safe is quick and easy, plus it can store up to 20 fingerprint scans - impressive!

The solid steel construction and smooth anti-scratch finish are top-notch. However, some users reported that after setting both compartments' codes and fingerprints, the top compartment may no longer open using those methods - requiring a key instead. Despite this issue reported by some customers, the majority seem satisfied with their purchase – well constructed and roomy enough for multiple firearms or valuables storage.

In summary, this high-capacity gun safe offers excellent security features for protecting your firearms at home. Keep in mind its few quirks before making your decision. \xa0

### [Biometric Bluetooth Smart Safe for Firearms and Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vaultek-vti-full-size-rugged-biometric-bluetooth-smart-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-vti-full-size-rugged-biometric-bluetooth-smart-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a happy owner of the Wincent Gun Safe, I've found it to be an excellent investment for securing my valuables. The quick high-resolution biometric scanner provides easy and fast access to the contents, while the rugged 14-gauge carbon steel construction ensures that my belongings are well protected. With features like the smart app integration, LED illuminated keypad, and impact detection system, this safe offers great security measures at a reasonable price.

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the ability to store up to 20 unique fingerprints. This allows my family members to access the safe as needed without any complications or hassle. Another feature that stands out is the anti-impact latches and advanced anti-theft protection that makes me feel confident in keeping my valuables secure from potential thieves.

However, there were some minor hiccups during setup initially due to lack of clear instructions in the booklet provided. Nonetheless, after turning to their website for guidance on installation and code setup, it was smooth sailing from there onwards. Some users reported issues with Bluetooth connectivity and fingerprint reader accuracy but these concerns were not significant enough in my experience with this product so far.

Overall, Wincent Gun Safe has exceeded my expectations with its sturdy build quality and robust security measures along with its quick access capabilities via biometric scan or phone app integration among other options available such as manual keys or nano key override access code generator if required by authorities which adds additional layers of security when necessary without compromising ease of use making it one heckuva deal!

### [Stylish Modern Hide A Bed Chair, Indoor Cat Cage Enclosure with Hammock, Secure Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stalwart-electronic-digital-gun-and-valuables-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe in my home for a few months now. The first thing that struck me about this product is its durability. Made of thick cold-rolled steel, it feels incredibly sturdy and reliable. Additionally, I appreciate the multiple access options, including a keypad, manual override key, and even a fingerprint feature (although some reviewers mentioned that the fingerprint feature wasn't always consistent).

Another aspect that really stood out to me was the alarm system. While it initially seems like a small detail, this added layer of security brought me peace of mind when storing my more valuable items. The LED display is also quite useful, showing me the current time, date, and last opening record, making it easy to keep track of when my safe was last accessed.

However, there are a couple of things I didn't quite love about this product. Setting up the electronic combination lock was a bit challenging initially. It took me a few tries to get it right, but after that, it's been smooth sailing. Another issue is the weight of the safe; at 21.7 lbs. , it's not the most portable safe out there, making it less convenient for those looking to move their safe frequently.

Overall, I would recommend the Stalwart Electronic Digital Gun and Valuables Safe for anyone in need of secure storage for their valuables. With its combination of sturdy construction, multiple access options, and useful features like an alarm system and LED display, it offers excellent protection for your most prized possessions.

I've been using the Liberty HD-200 Quick Vault in my nightstand for a few months now and I must say, it's been a game-changer. Its sturdy steel construction and quick and secure soft touch combo make it stand out among other gun safes. With over a thousand combination options and a lighted interior, accessing your firearms or valuables has never been easier or more secure.

One of the features that really sold me on this product is the auto-opening angled front door. It provides excellent visibility and easy access to your belongings without compromising on security. Plus, the backup key is always a welcome addition in case of emergencies.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported issues with the battery life, which can last anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. Additionally, although the product is generally well-built, there have been instances of mechanical malfunctions, such as the locking mechanism not working properly.

Despite these minor setbacks, I believe that the Liberty HD-200 Quick Vault offers unbeatable value for its price point. Its robust security features and user-friendly design make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their firearms and valuables.

As a reviewer who's been using the RPNB Gun Safe in my daily life, I must say it's the perfect home security addition for anyone looking to store their firearms securely. The biometric fingerprint sensor is incredibly responsive, providing quick access to your valuable belongings with just a touch of your finger. This feature stands out significantly, making it easy and efficient to use on a regular basis.

However, I did experience a minor issue where the fingerprint sensor occasionally failed to work on the first try. While this is not a significant problem, it's worth mentioning for those considering this product.

The heavy-duty security cable comes in handy, offering flexibility in placement and ensuring your safe remains secure wherever you choose to hide it. The 5-minute lock-down mode is also a welcome addition, providing a sense of security against potential intruders or curious children.

The RPNB Gun Safe boasts a sturdy construction, with 16-gauge carbon steel and a protective foam interior. This offers not only durability but also dependability for long-term use.

Overall, if you're in the market for a nightstand gun safe that offers quick access, robust security features, and a balance of practicality and reliability, the RPNB Gun Safe is definitely worth considering.

### [Digitally Secured Nightstand Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="surelock-quicktouch-200-digital-biometric-vault-3418948" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/surelock-quicktouch-200-digital-biometric-vault-3418948/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the SURELOCK Quick Touch Vault for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who needs to keep their handgun secure but easily accessible, this small, discreet safe does the job perfectly.

The stealth opening technology is a real highlight – I can access my belongings quickly and quietly without alerting anyone else in the room. The foam interior also provides additional protection for my valuables.

However, I did find one minor inconvenience. The power source, while versatile with the USB-C adaptor and AC adaptor, can run out of power faster than I'd like. But this is a small price to pay for the overall security and convenience it offers.

In summary, the SURELOCK Quick Touch Vault is a reliable and discreet option for those looking to secure their handguns or other small valuables. Its unique opening technology and sturdy construction make it a worthwhile investment.

### [Fingerprint-Activated Quick Access Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/nightstand-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

One of the standout features of the safe was its silent mode. This was especially helpful during nighttime when I needed to access my belongings without disturbing others in the house. The quick-access firearm storage, including space for two handguns and some magazines, allowed me to keep my weapons securely within reach.

However, there were a few cons to consider as well. The safe's size might be an issue for those looking for a more compact solution, and while it's relatively easy to mount, the included hardware could be more robust. Additionally, the biometric reader occasionally struggled to recognize my fingerprint accurately.

All in all, I was impressed with the RPNB Security Quick Access Biometric Fingerprint. Its high-quality construction, ample storage, and user-friendly features made it a reliable choice for safeguarding my valuables on a daily basis.

The VEVOR pistol safe with biometric access stands out with its three quick access modes: fingerprints, passwords, and keys. I've set up multiple fingerprints, and unlocking is incredibly swift, taking less than a second. The accuracy rate is more than impressive, hovering above 98%.

The convenient installation options make this safe suitable for different locations. I use it as a bedside accessory for added security in the night. The interior features corrugated and flat foam lining, removable for added convenience. The 2 or 3mm thick Q235 cold-rolled steel provides optimal strength and durability. An LED light with a silent mode enhances its usability during nighttime.

While its compact size offers ample storage space, it comes with extra batteries and screws, ensuring everything stays secure. In our experience, it has been an ideal addition to our home security setup. The VEVOR pistol safe has lived up to its hype and has made a significant difference in our lives. However, one thing I wish it had was a strong magnet at the back for vertical wall mounting. But overall, it's been a valuable addition to our household.
