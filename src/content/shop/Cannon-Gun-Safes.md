### [Cannon 20+4 Gun Fire-Resistant Safe: Ultimate Protection for Your Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cannon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-20-long-gun-4-hand-gun-13-1-cu-ft-convertible-safe-30-min-fire-rating-ts5722-h12heb-24/public"/></a></div>

My experience with the Cannon TS5722 20+4 gun fire-resistant safe has been excellent. I was impressed with the interior luxury, which includes soft materials to prevent scratches, and the adjustable shelving system made organizing my valuables a breeze. The factory-installed door organization kit holds up my pistols securely, providing extra peace of mind.

The heavy-duty construction is another standout feature - it includes a solid steel unibody design, three 1" diameter steel live-action locking bolts, and TruLock internal hinge system that prevents pry attacks. This adds to my confidence in the product's ability to protect my belongings from potential thieves or fires.

Although storage capacity is ample for essential items like documents or jewelry along with weapons, fitting the maximum advertised number of firearms might be challenging due to space constraints. The electronic lock comes with a backup key for emergencies; however, some users have reported occasional difficulty getting all long guns inside without crowding them together and a relatively small interior depth.

Despite these minor issues, this safe provides great value for money considering its high-quality build combined with security features such as Triple Fin seal protection against drill attacks – making it perfect not only for those looking to protect their valuables but also those seeking a reliable solution to store their firearm collection safely away from children's reach while remaining easily accessible when needed most!
