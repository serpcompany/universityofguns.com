As an avid fisherman, I couldn't resist the quirky design of the Gentlemen's Hardware Fish Penknife. At 2. 5 inches long, it's perfect to carry in my pocket while out at the lake or river. The brass body has a classic vintage aesthetic, and the fish-shaped design adds a playful touch that always grabs attention from fellow anglers.
