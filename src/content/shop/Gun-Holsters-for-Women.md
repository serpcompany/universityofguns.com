### [Custom Comfort Flex Holster for S&W M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield. This holster is designed to be worn inside the waistband, providing both concealment and comfort. It's been a game-changer for me in terms of carrying my firearm discreetly and comfortably.

The highlight of this holster for me is the custom molded polymer front. It's specifically shaped to fit my weapon perfectly, ensuring a secure fit and easy draw. Another standout feature is the closed-cell foam padding that keeps the weapon away from my body, preventing any discomfort or sweat buildup.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the holster tends to scratch the slide of my gun. It's not a deal breaker, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be concerned about maintaining the condition of their firearms.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster. It provides excellent concealment and comfort, making it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their firearm discreetly and securely.

### [Tactical Multi-Purpose Belly Band Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-belly-band-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

It's versatile and comfortable, perfect for activities like walks, jogs, hikes, bike rides, and even everyday use. The 3D Spacer Mesh Fabric ensures all-day carrying comfort, and the breathable open-air weave keeps you cool and dry.

One of the best features is the Hard Laminate Trigger Shield. It protects your trigger from accidental discharges, ensuring safety at all times. The elastic pockets are also a standout feature. They're perfect for keeping spare mags, knives, flashlights, and pepper spray handy. The secure YKK zippered storage pockets are another bonus.

### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [TheCHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster Gun Sox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cheata-tactical-ankle-holster-gun-sox-1/public"/></a></div>

When it comes to my everyday carry, being able to secure my firearm discreetly and comfortably is a top priority. That's why I decided to give the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster a try. I'm not one for flashy options, so the Gun Sox in black really caught my eye.

From the moment I put it on, I was impressed by the smooth draw and the fact that there was no shifting or sliding down my leg. It was so comfortable that I forgot I was carrying my firearm, which is a huge plus for me.

One feature that stood out was the proprietary Pant Protector. This little addition prevented any damage to my pant leg fabric from the gun sight, which was a nice surprise.

However, I did have one issue with the product - it wasn't true to size, so I had to return it. Despite this minor inconvenience, I believe that the CHEATA Tactical Ankle Holster is definitely worth considering for anyone looking for a comfortable and secure way to carry their small to mid-sized firearms.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/gun-holsters-for-women?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.
