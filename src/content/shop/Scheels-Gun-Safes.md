<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/scheels-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=scheels-gun-safes&utm_term=stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1"><img alt="stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stack-on-beveled-18-gun-security-cabinet-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe to secure my collection of firearms. After using it for several months, I have noticed some positive aspects as well as a few areas where it could improve.

One great feature of this gun safe is the key-coded cylinder lock and 4-way door locking, providing me with a sense of security when I'm away from my guns. The molded barrel rests and foam-padded bottom also help protect my antique firearms from any dings or scratches. These features make the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe stand out in terms of protection for your weapons.

However, there are a couple of issues that I have encountered during use. The instructions provided were low in quality, making assembly a bit challenging. Additionally, some users have reported durability issues with certain parts such as hinges and door latches, which can cause concern when relying on this product to protect your valuables over time.

Overall, the Stack-On 18 Firearm Compact Security Cabinet Locker Gun Safe does provide basic protection for your firearms with its sturdy structure and multiple locks. However, if you're looking for something more heavy-duty or long lasting in terms of construction quality, this might not be the ideal option for you.

The adjustable shelving is another highlight. Having the flexibility to customize the interior layout based on my specific needs is a game-changer.

One drawback worth mentioning is the weight of the safe. While it's reassuring to know how solidly built it is, moving it around can be quite challenging, especially if you're not used to handling heavy objects.
