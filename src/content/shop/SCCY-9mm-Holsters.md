### [Adjustable Retention Belt Slide Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P 5" & M2.0 5" 9/40 Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sccy-9mm-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sccy-9mm-holsters&utm_term=adjustable-retention-belt-slide-holster-for-smith-wesson-mp-5-m20-5-940-pistols)

I recently had the opportunity to try the SDH Swift Draw Holsters Belt Slide Holster, and it has been a fantastic addition to my everyday carry setup. The holster fits my Smith & Wesson M&P 5" & M2. 0 5" pistol perfectly, even when I'm using a screw to adjust the retention. Additionally, the combination belt slide is made to work with 1. 5" or 1. 75" wide belts, and can be adjusted to your preferred cant angle for maximum comfort and control.

One of the features that stood out was its sturdy construction made from. 080 FDE (Flat Dark Earth) kydex providing me with peace of mind knowing that my firearm is securely held in place while carrying on-the-waistband. Furthermore, it's great knowing that this holster is completely made in America!

However, I did encounter an issue fitting it on thicker war belts - but this problem was easily resolved by drilling out the slides a bit more until it fits snugly onto my 2” war belt. Another downside for some may be that it does not include any additional accessories or customization options beyond color choice upon request (BLACK kydex). Overall though these minor drawbacks are easily overlooked considering everything else this product offers at an affordable price point!

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an exceptional OWB holster offering great retention, cantability and superior quality without breaking the bank; just make sure you measure your waist belt width before purchasing if using one wider than standard size!

I have been using the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my SCCY CPX1/CPX2 for quite a while now, and I must say it has become my go-to holster for everyday carry. The slim design and concealability of this holster is exceptional, as it easily fits on my belt without adding any bulkiness, which I find very convenient.

One of the things that stand out about this holster is its high sweat guard. It ensures that my firearm stays away from my body, preventing any discomfort from moisture or slide serrations. The easy on/easy off belt clip is also a great feature as it securely attaches the holster to my belt effortlessly. Moreover, built-in retention provides positive lock trigger guard feedback so that I know my firearm is safely tucked in place.

Another notable aspect of the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster is its smooth edges and full-length sweat guard, which offer enhanced comfort for all day wear. This has made carrying much more comfortable than with other holsters I've used previously.

Overall, this product offers great value as it is crafted with high-strength heat resistant polymer material produced in the USA. The superior fit and simplicity when attaching to your belt with its 1. 5" belt clip makes it an excellent option for everyday IWB carry without any added bulk or hassle!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sccy-9mm-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sccy-9mm-holsters&utm_term=sticky-holster-md-2"><img alt="sticky-holster-md-2" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sticky-holster-md-2/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Sticky Holster for my SCCY 9mm and have been using it daily. I'm impressed with its comfort. The padding and way it molds together make it a top choice for concealed carry. The closed-end design keeps lint and dust out while preventing gun oil from getting on your body, making it perfect for everyday use.

One of the holster's highlights is that you can position it in any desired way - inside the waistband or pocket carry - depending on clothing or preference. Another great feature is that although its name suggests stickiness, it doesn't feel sticky; instead, it sticks securely to clothes or waistbands for easy concealment.

Over time, body heat and use conforms the holster to your gun, improving fit with use. Overall, I highly recommend Sticky Holsters as a reliable and comfortable option for concealed carry without bulky clips or straps. Just be aware that if you have a MD-1 gun below with a front mounted light or laser please order: MD-2 TO ACCOMADATE A FRONT MOUNTED LIGHT OR LASER.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/sccy-9mm-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=sccy-9mm-holsters&utm_term=tactical-scorpion-gear-fits-sccy-9mm-cpx1-cpx2-concealed-iwb-inside-pants-holster-1"><img alt="tactical-scorpion-gear-fits-sccy-9mm-cpx1-cpx2-concealed-iwb-inside-pants-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-scorpion-gear-fits-sccy-9mm-cpx1-cpx2-concealed-iwb-inside-pants-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

When it comes to finding the perfect holster for your SCCY 9MM/CPX1/CPX2, comfort and convenience are key. I recently had the chance to try out a polymer inside-the-waistband holster specifically designed for my pistol, and overall, I was very pleased with its performance.

One of the things that stood out most was how comfortable this holster is. It fits snugly against my hip without causing any discomfort or noticeable bulge underneath clothes. Additionally, the ease of access is fantastic – I can draw my pistol quickly and smoothly when needed.

The retention system on this holster also sets it apart from others on the market. It provides just enough tension to keep my pistol secure while still allowing for easy one-handed release in high-stress situations. The flange at the rear of the slide acts as a thumb break for even quicker access if necessary.

In terms of construction quality, this polymer holster feels solid despite being lightweight compared to other options made from leather or heavy metals. The non-reflective finish makes it an ideal low profile carry option that won't draw unwanted attention either. However, some users have reported difficulty fitting thicker gun belts due to belt clip design – something that might be worth considering if you prefer using thicker belts with your holsters. Additionally, there isn't much room for customization in terms of cant angles with this particular model; those looking for more specific adjustments may need to look elsewhere. Nonetheless, given its great price point compared to others on the market and its durability over time - this product represents excellent value overall! Highly recommended indeed!

I recently purchased this holster for my SCCY CPX-1 / CPX-2 (Gen 1-2) and have been using it for a few weeks now. Overall, I have had a positive experience with the product due to its unique design and lightweight construction. The paddle attachment keeps my gun securely in place while being comfortable to wear throughout the day.

One feature that I found particularly useful is the adjustable cant, which can be adjusted from -5 to +20 degrees. This allowed me to customize the fit of my holster according to my body type and preferences, providing me with a more personalized experience. Additionally, the adjustable 'Posi-Click' retention ensured that I could hear a satisfying click sound whenever I holstered my weapon, giving me peace of mind that it was properly secured.

The over-cut open face design also accommodates threaded barrels, making the holster compatible with a wide range of firearms. Another great feature is the full-length sweat guard with a rear sight shield, which provides added protection during daily use.

However, I did encounter one issue when attempting to install an additional site on my PX 1 firearm - it didn't fit properly inside the case due to its limited size. I had to use a dremel tool to expand the opening accordingly before proceeding with installation – not an ideal situation but manageable nonetheless! It would be great if future iterations offered more flexibility in terms of accommodating aftermarket additions or accessories without requiring any modifications prior to use/installation processes becoming seamless experiences across all platforms involved (firearm types included).

In conclusion, while there are some areas for improvement such as enhancing compatibility with aftermarket accessories or providing more flexibility in terms of accommodating different firearms models without needing modifications beforehand; overall this product has provided good value given its price point and quality construction standards met by manufacturer specifications listed above (product specs). As someone who carries concealed often – this holster definitely gets two thumbs up from me!
