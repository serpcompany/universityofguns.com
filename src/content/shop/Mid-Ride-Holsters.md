I recently purchased the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Sig P365, and have been quite impressed with its performance. The slim design makes it easy to conceal, even when wearing light clothing. One of the most significant features is the high sweat guard, which keeps my firearm off my body and prevents any discomfort from moisture or slide serrations.

Additionally, I really appreciate the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard - these provide tangible feedback to ensure that my firearm is securely stored in place.
