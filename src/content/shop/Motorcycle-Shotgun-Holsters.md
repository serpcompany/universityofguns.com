The mount securely holds my holstered firearm in place, whether I'm at my office desk or driving in my truck. Its dual locking design provides assurance that the weapon won't fall out, even on bumpy roads.

One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost! With its lightweight design and dual locking mechanism, you can rest assured that your firearm remains safe and secure while on-the-go or stored away when not needed.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1"><img alt="desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-vld-prtnr-hellcat-blk-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the DeSantis VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk holster for quite some time now, and it's been quite the game-changer. This outside waistband (OWB) holster is specifically designed for the Springfield Armory Hellcat, and it's been a perfect fit. The black color is sleek and adds a subtle touch to my everyday attire.

One of the things that stood out for me with this holster is its ability to be easily accessed in an emergency. The OWB design is super convenient and quick when it comes to retrieving my Hellcat. The high-quality materials used in its construction are durable and make me feel confident in its long-term use.

In terms of comfort, the VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk has been a dream. Its slim design makes it incredibly comfortable to wear all day without sacrificing concealment. I appreciate how the adjustable cant and tension allow me to customize the fit and draw speed to my preference.

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a few minor cons. The retention system can be a bit stiff initially, but it loosens up over time. Additionally, while the holster is suitable for right-handed users, left-handed shooters might not find it as practical.

All in all, I would highly recommend the DeSantis VLD PRTNR Hellcat Blk to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable holster for their Springfield Armory Hellcat. Its unique design and solid retention make it a top choice in the market.

### [Ambidextrous IWB Mossberg MC2C Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=ambidextrous-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-holster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-slim-tuk-iwb-mossberg-mc2c-ambidextrous-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Desantis Gunhole Slim-TUK IWB Mossberg MC2C Ambidextrous, and I must say, it's an interesting piece of equipment. The minimalistic design appealed to me initially, but what really stands out is the adjustable tension and rugged 1.75-inch nylon clip that comes with it.

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the tuck-able 360 C-clip, as it provides me with numerous mounting options, making it versatile in various situations. Another notable thing about this IWB holster is the hardware that can be easily flipped to change from right to left-hand orientation for ambidextrous usage.

However, there are certain downsides too. It lacks a certain level of fit for my Mossberg MC2C, which could be a significant issue. Furthermore, the design isn't perfect; the gap between the barrel and the end of the holster is somewhat frustrating.

Overall, this holster offers some unique benefits but also has its limitations. It could be a good choice for those looking for a minimalistic and versatile IWB holster, but I would recommend trying it out with your gun first before making a purchase decision.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

### [Great Day Quick-Draw Overhead Motorcycle Shotgun Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=great-day-quick-draw-overhead-motorcycle-shotgun-holsters)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/motorcycle-shotgun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=motorcycle-shotgun-holsters&utm_term=great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-qd852-ogr-1"><img alt="great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-qd852-ogr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/great-day-quick-draw-overhead-gun-rack-qd852-ogr-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Great Day Quick-Draw Overhead Gun Rack in my utility vehicle, and it's been a game-changer for me as a hunter. The racks are incredibly easy to install, taking no more than a few minutes without any drilling or bolting required, which is perfect for those of us who aren't super handy. The aircraft aluminum construction is not only lightweight but also durable, making it a long-lasting addition to your vehicle.

One of the standout features for me is the super-soft rubber gun clips that securely hold my firearms. They provide easy access while also keeping them protected from damage during transport. Plus, their adjustable design means they can accommodate various makes and models of utility vehicles, making them versatile as well.

However, there are some downsides. In my case, I found that the provided all-thread was a bit too short for my Honda Pioneer 1000, so I had to weld on non-threaded stubs to extend it. This wasn't a significant issue, but it did add extra time and effort to the installation process. Additionally, if you're particularly tall, you might find that the racks slightly limit your headroom.

All in all, the Great Day Quick-Draw Overhead Gun Rack has become an essential piece of equipment for me on hunting trips. Its ease of installation, secure firearm storage, and durability make it worth the investment.
