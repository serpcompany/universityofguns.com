### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD 3](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/springfield-911-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/springfield-911-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Springfield XD 3" extensively, I can confidently vouch for its durability and exceptional build quality. Made from a strong polymer blend, this holster is designed to last. Its IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut ensures quick muzzle clearance, while the precision molded design provides a perfect fit for my firearm.

Although it shares similar features with the Classic OWB Holster at a lower price point, it isn't without its flaws. Some users have reported difficulty in unlocking the secondary lock during action-packed situations like USPSA competitions - an area where improvement could be made in future versions. Additionally, some users noted issues with retention adjustment requiring screws - an easier method could be considered for future models as well.

On the positive side, this holster offers many attachment options to meet various requirements. The positive locking trigger guard also keeps my firearm secure during rigorous training sessions. With its versatile mounting pattern and compatibility with our wide range of attachments, it's no surprise that this holster is a favorite among competitive shooters.

Overall, while there are some areas that could be improved, I still consider this holster to be a reliable option for carrying outside the waistband given its performance relative to its price point.

I recently got my hands on the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster and I must say, it has become an essential part of my gear as a competitive shooter. The holster is made from a strong, heat-resistant polymer which ensures that my firearm stays secure and safe. The adjustable retention feature allows me to customize the fit of the holster around my gun, ensuring it stays in place even during intense training sessions.

One of my favorite features is the IDPA legal optic ready speed cut which allows for quick and effective clearing of the muzzle out of the holster. This has significantly improved my draw speed during competitions, giving me an edge over other participants. Additionally, the compatibility with various belt attachments provides versatility in how I choose to carry my firearm outside the waistband.

The precision molding technique used in manufacturing this holster ensures that it fits perfectly with my specific firearm model. This eliminates any issues with retention or draw speed due to poor fitment that can be encountered with other holsters on the market. The positive locking trigger guard provides tactile feedback, giving me peace of mind knowing that even when rigorously training or competing, my firearm is securely in place.

While I have been extremely satisfied with this product thus far, there are some areas for improvement like providing more options to precisely adjust the angle/cant of the holster/pistol which would be helpful for users who prefer a more customized fit. However, given its price point and durability compared to other options within its range, I believe that this product offers great value for money spent!
