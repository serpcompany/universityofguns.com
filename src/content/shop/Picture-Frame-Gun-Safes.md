The digital keypad is easy to use, and itâ€™s great to have a built-in removable storage shelf for extra organization. The steel construction feels sturdy, providing security when storing my guns.

One thing to note is that when the door is open, it tends to tip forward slightly due to the weight of the safe. This issue can be resolved by mounting the safe using the included hardware. Other than this small concern, this product offers great value for money and does an exceptional job of keeping firearms secure from unauthorized access.

Overall, I would recommend Telamâ€™s gun safe as a reliable option for anyone looking for quick access and added security measures to protect their firearms at home or on-the-go trips!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=remington-sar6556n-nitro-568-gun-safe-1"><img alt="remington-sar6556n-nitro-568-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar6556n-nitro-568-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Remington Nitro SAR6556N Fireproof Gun Safe truly stands out in terms of sturdiness, visual appeal, and craftsmanship.

I recently had the chance to try out this elegant beige wooden picture frame gun safe, and I must say, it's a unique blend of both decorative and functional. The solid wood construction with its beige finish adds an air of sophistication to any space while providing discreet storage for your valuables.

However, one thing to keep in mind is that the safe is non-waterproof, which may be an issue if you live in an area with high humidity or frequent moisture exposure. Although some users may find the limited interior space slightly inconvenient for storing larger items or a significant amount of cash, most reviewers found it perfectly suitable for smaller valuables like jewelry or important documents.

Personally, I found this picture frame gun safe to be a great addition to my collection of safety devices. It adds a touch of elegance to my living space while still being practical and providing peace of mind. If you're looking for an inconspicuous way to protect your belongings without sacrificing style, then this might just be what you need!

### [Wide Body Gun Safe with Fire Protection and Adjustable Shelving](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=wide-body-gun-safe-with-fire-protection-and-adjustable-shelving)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=safeandvaultstore-gs593625-second-amendment-gun-safe-1"><img alt="safeandvaultstore-gs593625-second-amendment-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safeandvaultstore-gs593625-second-amendment-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the SafeandVaultStore GS593625 Second Amendment Gun Safe for a few months, I am impressed with its sturdy construction and exceptional features. This gun safe provides a solid level of protection, with its two layers of 12 gauge steel and one-hour factory certified fire rating tested at temperatures up to 1700 degrees F.

One of the standout features is the Digital Electronic Lock which is both easy to program and use. The interior is fully upholstered with plush grey carpeting, providing an extra layer of protection for my belongings, as well as a classy touch. Another highlight was the superb customer service from the Safe and Vault store; they were incredibly helpful throughout my entire experience.

However, there are a few areas where this product could be improved upon. For example, it would be beneficial if it had more shelving options or adjustable shelves to accommodate different sized firearms or accessories better. Additionally, while the electronic lock works well overall, it can sometimes feel sluggish when entering multiple passcodes in quick succession -- though this issue has not caused significant problems so far.

Overall, I would recommend this gun safe for anyone looking for excellent quality at an affordable price point who needs basic security features that are easy to use without any bells and whistles that might complicate operation or maintenance down the line.

### [High-Quality Wood Gun Safe with Adjustable Shelving and Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=high-quality-wood-gun-safe-with-adjustable-shelving-and-fire-protection)

I recently purchased the Cabela's Classic Series Gun Safe, and I must say, it has been a great investment for my gun collection. The safe is sturdy and well-constructed with a 12-gauge steel body and 11 layers of fireboard, providing me with peace of mind knowing that my valuables are protected against potential fires. Additionally, the heavy-duty locking bars deter any unauthorized access to the safe's contents.

One of my favorite features is the adjustable shelving within the safe. This allows me to customize the layout for maximum storage capacity and organization of my firearms. Moreover, the interior door panel offers extra handgun storage space which is quite convenient. Accessing my guns is quick and secure thanks to the tool-resistant lock and 3-point chrome handle design. The Palusol heat-expanding door seal also provides added protection during extreme conditions such as fires or break-ins.

Although this product has met most of my expectations, there are some areas where improvements could be made: Some customers have reported difficulty fitting scoped long rifles due to limited space inside â€“ something worth considering before making your purchase decision if you own scoped weapons as well! Additionally, a few isolated incidents reported broken welds preventing locks from engaging properly upon delivery â€“ however these issues seem rare among all purchases made thus far so hopefully wonâ€™t impact most buyers out there looking at getting one themselves soon too!

### [Remington Express 44-Gun Safe: Fireproof, Waterproof, and UL-Rated Security for Protection and Craftsmanship](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=remington-express-44-gun-safe-fireproof-waterproof-and-ul-rated-security-for-protection-and-craftsmanship)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/picture-frame-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=picture-frame-gun-safes&utm_term=remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1"><img alt="remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/remington-sar5944e-express-446-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Remington Express 44-Gun Safe has become a favorite addition to my home security setup, thanks to its impressive combination of fireproof and waterproof capabilities. The 12-gauge industrial steel body with Triple Seal technology provides excellent protection for my firearms and valuables in the event of a fire, while preventing internal damage from leaks or flooding.

Among the standout features are the SecuRam UL Rated electronic lock, twelve sturdy steel locking bolts, and a relocker device â€“ all offering maximum security to keep my possessions safe from unauthorized access. The motion-activated LED lights installed inside the safe make it easy to locate and retrieve items in low light conditions.

The interior is fully carpeted and includes several storage options such as a deluxe pocket door organizer, barrel rests, and adjustable side shelves for customizing the setup according to your needs. Charging gun safe accessories at home is effortless with integrated UL Rated dual power outlets and two USB ports.

That said, it would have been great if there were additional padding on some areas of the doors or shelves to better protect more delicate items like scopes or other gear that could be potentially scratched by metal on metal contact while opening or closing doors quickly. Also, I find myself having slightly more difficulty when trying to use this item as an actual picture frame due to its weightiness - though this isn't necessarily surprising given its sturdy construction meant for long-lasting protection instead of purely decorative purposes; ultimately reinforcing why investment pieces like these should always be carefully considered based on their intended use cases before purchase!

### Considerations for Choosing a Picture Frame Gun Safe

Here are some important factors to consider when selecting a picture frame gun safe:
