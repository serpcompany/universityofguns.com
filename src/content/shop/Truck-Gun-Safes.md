### [Cannon 48 Long Gun + 6 Handgun Safe with E-Lock and 45 Minute Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-safe-with-e-lock-and-45-minute-fire-rating)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1"><img alt="cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cannon-48-long-gun-6-handgun-e-lock-45-min-fire-rating-gun-safe-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Cannon TS5934 Gun Safe and have been using it for the past month. Assembly was a bit challenging, so I enlisted some help due to its weight. The size is perfect for my storage needs, as it accommodates 48 long guns and 6 handguns comfortably. The door organization is a nice touch, providing ample space for smaller items. The carpeted interior with black leatherette trim ensures that my valuables are protected from scratches and damage.

The electronic lock and keypad work seamlessly, giving me peace of mind about accessing my safe's content when needed. However, I have concerns about the quality of some components such as the plastic shelf retainer clips which seem flimsy and could potentially break easily over time. Additionally, while the safe is fire-rated for 45 minutes at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, there isn't enough information available on its fire resistance capabilities to give me complete confidence in its ability to protect my belongings in case of a fire.

Overall, this product meets most of my expectations in terms of securing my firearms and other valuable items. Despite minor concerns about component quality and fire resistance information, it serves its purpose well in keeping my possessions safe from potential threats such as thieves or fires.

I recently purchased the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. As a gun enthusiast, I needed a safe that could not only protect my long guns but also keep them organized. The Winchester safe has exceeded my expectations in terms of storage, accessibility, and security.

One of the most impressive features of this safe is its 45-minute fire rating, which means it can withstand temperatures up to 1400°F for 45 minutes. This gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuable firearms and possessions will be protected in case of a fire emergency.

The spacious interior of the safe is perfect for accommodating up to 26 long guns, making it an ideal choice for both gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. The adjustable shelves and door organizer provide ample storage options for handguns and other valuables, ensuring that everything is easily accessible when needed.

Another great thing about the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe is its electronic lock, which ensures secure access to your firearms. Additionally, the override key provides a reliable backup in case of emergencies.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this safe. Some users have reported that the door may have some play in it once it's closed and locked, but this doesn't detract from the overall security provided by the locking mechanism.

Overall, I highly recommend the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe to anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and well-organized gun safe. Its steel construction, fire rating, and accessibility features make it a top choice in its price range.

### [24-Gun ProVault Flex Safe for Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=24-gun-provault-flex-safe-for-firearms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1"><img alt="provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/provault-flex-loaded-24-gun-safe-by-liberty-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who actually used the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty, I must say it provides ample storage and good protection for your firearms. The Flex shelving system definitely stands out, allowing you to customize the interior to fit your specific storage needs, whether for long-guns or a combination of firearms and other valuables. The door panel offers extra storage for handguns and additional valuables, further enhancing its versatility.

On the downside, the spot-welded rear plate could be a concern for some users, as mentioned in certain reviews. Additionally, some reviewers mentioned that certain features, like the door panel, can limit the number of long-guns you can store depending on their optics.

From my experience, the safe is well built, easy to use, and offers peace of mind that your firearms are securely stored. The electronic lock is straightforward to set up and has a 5-year warranty, which adds an extra layer of security.

In summary, the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty offers an excellent balance of features, security, and affordability for those looking for a reliable gun safe. Just be aware of the potential limitations in terms of storage capacity, especially if you have longer barreled firearms with scopes.

### [Sturdy Bulldog Car Vault for Gun & Valuables Security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=sturdy-bulldog-car-vault-for-gun-valuables-security)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/truck-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=truck-gun-safes&utm_term=bulldog-car-safe-1"><img alt="bulldog-car-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-car-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Bulldog Car Vault is my go-to solution for securing my handgun while on the go. Its compact size allows it to seamlessly fit in various vehicles, such as cars, trucks, boats, and even the office. The mounting bracket provides a secure way to keep your valuable items safe from prying eyes. Even when not locked, the vault can be secured using the versatile 3-foot security cable.

Speaking from experience, I appreciate the heavy-duty steel construction of the vault, which offers ample protection for whatever I store inside. The soft, scratch-resistant lining adds an extra layer of protection to help prevent any damage to your belongings. The dimensions of this vault are 8.7" x 6" x 2.5", allowing it to fit different handguns and some accompanying accessories comfortably. The overall look of the Car Vault is sleek, with a black matte powder paint finish that adds a touch of elegance.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I have to say, the screws that come with it don't seem to work well on sheet metal surfaces. Instead of the more appropriate universal metal type screws, the mounting kit would benefit from more aggressive ones. Additionally, while the security cable is a lovely feature for added security, it could be sturdier.

Overall, the Bulldog Car Vault offers a convenient and cost-effective means for safely storing handguns in various settings. It is especially useful for those who frequently travel across state lines, where different firearm laws apply. Its durability and unique design make it a worthy contender in the realm of portable safes.

My experience with the Tuffy Security Products 300-01 Portable Safe has been nothing short of exceptional. I initially purchased it to secure my firearms while traveling, but I've discovered that it's incredibly versatile and can be used in various settings. Its lightweight design makes it easy to carry by hand, but don't let that fool you - this safe is built with high security welded steel construction that provides unmatched protection.

One of my favorite features is the compression bumpers that keep the lid vibration-free when closed, ensuring that my valuable items remain secure at all times. The foam-lined interior also provides an added layer of protection for my belongings.

However, there is a minor downside to this product. The locking mechanism might take some time to get used to, as it requires a bit of practice to align the two-point steel cam correctly.

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Tuffy Security Products 300-01 Portable Safe. Its durability, craftsmanship, and ease of use make it a must-have for anyone looking to secure their valuables while on the go or at home.
