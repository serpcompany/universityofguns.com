### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/public"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is my go-to accessory for my 1911 5" Government. This modular system is perfect for those who like to switch things up and try different carry positions throughout the day. With just a few quick adjustments, I can easily transform the ShapeShift from an IWB holster for casual outings to an OWB paddle holster for more active pursuits.

However, I did encounter some issues with the bulkiness of the holster, especially when using the OWB setup. It's clear that this product is designed with professionals like security personnel or police officers in mind. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and seems a bit wobbly when engaged.

On the positive side, though, the Alien Gear ShapeShift is made in the USA, which is a strong selling point for those who prefer American-made products. And let's not forget the bonus Holster Mount that comes with the Core Carry Pack – it's incredibly versatile and makes it easy to secure my ShapeShift to a variety of surfaces.

In conclusion, while the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack offers a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying positions, it may not be the most comfortable or practical option for everyone. If you're open to trying out various carrying styles and are okay with a slightly bulky design, this product might be worth considering. But if you prioritize comfort and convenience above all else, it might be best to keep looking.

### [Crucial Concealment Covert Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I've recently been using the "Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO" in my day-to-day routine and must say it's been quite an experience. The minimalistic design isn't just for show, it really does deliver on its promise of effective concealment without sacrificing comfort.

One of the standout features for me was the trigger bump. It added an extra layer of safety without being intrusive or uncomfortable, which is quite impressive. Plus, the fully adjustable cant and adjustable retention make it perfect for anyone, regardless of their preferences. Another thing that really caught my attention is how compatible it is with optics, making it a versatile choice for those looking to upgrade their gear.

However, there are some things that could be improved. While the holster material, kydex, is durable and reliable, it might not suit everyone's taste due to its hard and rigid nature. Additionally, some people might find the black color too plain and boring, but then again, that's mostly down to personal preferences.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient inside-the-waistband holster that offers solid concealment capabilities, the Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO would be a great choice.

Named after its exceptional ability to stay low-profile, the Crucial Concealment IWB FN is a fantastic addition to any shooter's collection. The holster stands out in terms of adjustable cant and retention for customized fitment, making it a perfect choice for both left-handers and right-handers. Notably, it's designed with optics compatibility, making it a versatile option for gun enthusiasts across the board.

I personally find the holster incredibly comfortable to wear and highly efficient in its purpose of concealed carry. Its minimalistic design ensures it seamlessly disappears under clothing. However, one minor inconvenience I've encountered is that it occasionally requires a tighter squeeze to achieve a smooth draw.

Overall, the Crucial Concealment IWB FN has been nothing short of a reliable companion in my daily life. Its adjustable features are definitely worth mentioning, as they offer a tailored fit and ease of use. Despite a minor drawback, I feel confident recommending this product to other enthusiasts for its exceptional concealment capability.

I've been using the Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System for my Springfield Hellcat, and I have to say, it's been quite an adventure. The ShapeShift Core Carry Pack offers a quick and easy way to transform your holster into four distinct carrying styles - IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster. What I found most interesting is how versatile it can be. However, it can get quite bulky, which might not appeal to all users. The thumb release is also a bit of a challenge to push down and feels a bit wobbly. Though, I must admit, the holster looks great with my Springfield Hellcat.

Despite its bulky design, the ShapeShift's modularity is a major plus. It caters to different carrying preferences and is made in the USA, which is a testament to its quality. Overall, it's a versatile and convenient holster system that might not suit everyone's taste, but it definitely has its own unique charm.

### [Integrated LockLeather IWB Hybrid Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/urban-carrier-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/urbancarry-ll-iwb-201-bk-l-lock-leather-iwb-left-holster-black-size-no-202/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's tried and tested the LockLeather IWB holster, I can attest that it's a high-quality and comfortable accessory for any firearm enthusiast. Its unique locking mechanism integrated into the leather design ensures secure retention of your weapon while maintaining a sleek profile for concealed carry.

However, not all experiences have been positive. Some users found it difficult to adjust the cant or position of the holster, which affected their comfort and ease of drawing the firearm. Additionally, the lack of adjustability may limit where you can wear it on your body.

On the flip side, others praised the superior quality of the leather and stitching, comparing it favourably to more expensive custom holsters. They also appreciated the holster's ability to maintain its shape when drawing or re-holstering their weapon.

In conclusion, the LockLeather IWB holster offers a secure and concealable option for those looking to carry their firearms, but some may find the design limitations uncomfortable or inconvenient. Regardless, its high-quality construction and unique retention mechanism make it worth considering for anyone in need of a reliable holster.
