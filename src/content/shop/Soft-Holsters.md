### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for FN FNX-45 Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster has proven to be a reliable and durable option for my FN FNX-45 Tactical. Its high-quality construction, crafted from Boltaron in the USA, provides a precise and secure fit that I can trust on the range or in competition.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the adjustable retention screws. These allow me to customize the level of security between my firearm and the holster with ease. Additionally, the optic ready speed cut design provides me with an edge during competitions by enabling quick clearance of the muzzle out of the holster. It's no surprise that both IDPA and USPSA have legalized this product for use in their competitions, further showcasing its effectiveness.

Another great aspect of this holster is its modular mounting holes which provide versatility when tailoring it to my specific draw and ride preferences using Blade-Tech's compatible attachments. The positive locking trigger guard also offers tactile feedback while storing my firearm safely throughout the day without any concerns about accidental exposure or loss.

However, there were some minor issues when initially setting up this product as some adjustment screws spun freely instead of securing into place once set up according to desired positioning - something which was resolved through customer support assistance via email correspondences within a reasonable timeframe nevertheless. Despite these small hiccups, overall –this remains a solid choice worth considering for those looking for reliable carry options.

### [ProDraw OWB Kydex Holster for Open Carry and Range Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vedder-holsters-prodraw-owb-paddle-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vedder-holsters-prodraw-owb-paddle-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to test out the ProDraw OWB Kydex holster by Vedder Holsters, and I must say, it has definitely become one of my top choices. The fit of this holster is impeccable with a precise design that creates an audible click every time I holster my gun, giving me complete confidence in its security.

Among the features that set this holster apart are its adjustable retention, which allows for a perfect draw tailored to my personal preference, and a rubberized paddle that provides excellent adhesion to my pants for secure positioning during all sorts of activities. The construction quality is superior and the finish is top-notch, making it not only functional but visually appealing as well.

One aspect I appreciate about this product is its versatility - it functions optimally as both an open carry or range holster worn outside the waistband (OWB). Furthermore, each holster is meticulously handcrafted to match your specific gun model ensuring a perfect fit for your firearm.

Some users have reported issues with finding the correct height setting on the paddle mount and challenges bonding with new equipment at first; however, these concerns seem relatively minor when weighed against the numerous positive attributes of Vedder Holsters' product line. In conclusion, if you're searching for an exceptional OWB Kydex holster crafted with superior workmanship and premium materials - give ProDraw OWB Kydex serious consideration!

### [Slim and Discreet IWB Holster for Glock 43/43X/43X MOS](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="klipt-iwb-glock-43-43x-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klipt-iwb-glock-43-43x-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Glock 43 / 43X / 43X MOS as an everyday carry option for a few weeks now, and it has exceeded my expectations. The sleek, discreet design of the holster makes it easy to conceal under clothing without adding bulk or discomfort. I particularly appreciate the high sweat guard that keeps my firearm off my body, preventing any irritation from moisture or slide serrations.

One standout feature is the easy on/easy off belt clip - it securely attaches to belts up to 1. 5" wide and can be removed with ease when needed. Additionally, the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard provide tactile feedback that lets me know my firearm is safely secured at all times. Although there are no adjustments needed for built-in retention, which could be a drawback for some users who prefer customization options, I find this aspect convenient and hassle-free.

In terms of daily use, the holster has performed exceptionally well - providing ample comfort without sacrificing security features like smooth edges and full-length sweat guard. As someone who has tried several different IWB holsters over the years, this one stands out as a reliable choice for everyday carry due to its balance of functionality and comfort.

Overall, I highly recommend this Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for anyone in search of an unobtrusive yet secure option for carrying their Glock 43 / 43X / 43X MOS on a daily basis.

### [Adjustable Comfortable Belly Band Holster for Left-Handed Users](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-left-hand-draw-size-regular-nude-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-left-hand-draw-size-regular-nude-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the ComfortTac The Ultimate Belly Band Holster for several weeks, I can confidently say that it has been a great addition to my everyday carry routine. Made of high-quality neoprene material, this versatile holster provides both comfort and concealment, allowing me to easily carry my firearm with ease.

One of the standout features of this holster is its ability to be worn in multiple positions. I've found that wearing it around my waist or hips works best for me, but it can also be tucked into the waistband of pants or worn higher up on the ribcage – providing a customized fit for users of different body types.

The built-in pocket and removable magazine pouch are thoughtful additions that further enhance the holster's functionality. The retention strap with deep concealment buckle not only ensures secure retention but also allows for quickdraw access when needed – a crucial feature for those carrying a firearm for protection.

However, there are some nuances to consider when using this product. As someone with more pronounced curves, I found that the straight design of the band didn't perfectly conform to my body shape and sometimes rode up above my waist or sat high under my bustline – occasionally making gripping and drawing my weapon more difficult than expected. Additionally, individuals with wider hips may need to purchase jeans two sizes larger than usual in order for the belly band holster system to fit properly around their body type.

Despite these minor concerns, ComfortTac The Ultimate Belly Band Holster remains an essential piece of gear in my daily carry routine thanks largely due its comfort and adaptability features combined together into one convenient package! Overall though despite some issues relating specifically towards certain body types fitting better than others; overall this product has been quite helpful during time spent testing out its capabilities thus far!

### [Glock 17/22/31/47 Signature OWB Holster - USA Made, Adjustable Retention and IDPA Legal Speed Cut](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

When choosing a soft holster for your firearm, there are several important features to consider:

- Retention: Ensure that the holster securely holds your gun and remains snug during movement. Retention can be achieved through straps, adjustable tension screws, or integrated tension systems.

- Comfort: Choose a soft holster made from comfortable materials, such as Kydex or leather. Also, consider the holster's design, which can affect ease of draw and overall comfort.

- Concealment: A good soft holster should help keep your gun hidden, whether you're wearing it inside or outside the waistband.

- Draw Speed: A fast draw is essential in emergency situations. Look for a holster with a smooth, efficient design for quick access.

- Durability: The holster should be made from durable materials that can withstand prolonged use and exposure to the elements.

### General Advice for Using a Soft Holster

When using a soft holster, keep these considerations in mind:

1. Practice regularly with your firearm and holster to ensure smooth and efficient draw speed.

2. Make sure the holster is compatible with your specific gun model to guarantee proper fit and function.

3. Clean and maintain your holster and firearm as recommended by the manufacturer to prevent damage or malfunction.

4. Choose a soft holster from a reputable manufacturer to ensure high quality and reliability.

### When Not to Use a Soft Holster

Soft holsters may not be the best option in specific situations:

- During intense physical activity, like running or climbing, a rigid holster may provide better retention.

- In regions with strict open-carry laws, a soft holster may not provide adequate concealment.

- When using a backup firearm, a more secure and rigid holster could be a better choice for quick access.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soft+Holsters-3/public" alt="Soft Holsters-3"></a></div>

## FAQ

### What are soft holsters?

Soft holsters are lightweight and flexible firearm holsters made from materials such as nylon, leather, or neoprene. They're designed to provide comfort and concealment when carrying your weapon.

### How do soft holsters compare to other types of holsters?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soft+Holsters-4/public" alt="Soft Holsters-4"></a></div>

Soft holsters are more comfortable than hardshell varieties as they conform to the wearer's body shape, offer more flexibility, and have a lower profile. However, they may provide slightly less retention compared to rigid holsters due to their material.

### Which type of gun is most suitable for a soft holster?

Soft holsters are best suited for smaller firearms like compact or subcompact pistols. Larger guns may be more challenging to conceal and could require a different type of holster for proper support and retention.

### How do I determine the right size soft holster for my gun?

Consider the dimensions of your firearm, especially the length of the slide, grip width, and overall height. Measure your gun and compare with the manufacturer's sizing chart for accurate fitting.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soft+Holsters-5/public" alt="Soft Holsters-5"></a></div>

### Are soft holsters suitable for left-handed shooters?

Yes, many soft holsters are ambidextrous and can be worn on either side of the shooter's body, making them suitable for both left- and right-handed individuals.

### How do I clean and maintain a soft holster?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/soft-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soft+Holsters-6/public" alt="Soft Holsters-6"></a></div>

Retention straps help keep the firearm securely inside the holster, preventing unintentional dis charge or unholstering. This safety feature is especially important for those who engage in high-intensity activities while carrying their weapon.

### How should I store my soft holster when not in use?

To prolong the life of your soft holster, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. It's also a good idea to keep it separate from other cleaning supplies or chemicals that could damage the material.
