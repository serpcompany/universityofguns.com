### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD-M 5.25](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster has truly lived up to its reputation when it comes to my Springfield XD-M 5. 25". Constructed with a strong proprietary mix of polymers, the durability and rigidity are top-notch. The IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut helps me efficiently clear the muzzle out of the holster, while precision molding ensures a perfect fit for my firearm.

One feature I greatly appreciate is the positive locking trigger guard that provides tactile feedback, giving me peace of mind that my firearm is secure. Additionally, the adjustable retention allows me to customize the fit for my gun as needed. Compatible with multiple belt attachments, this holster is clearly a favorite in competitive shooting circles.

However, there are some minor downsides worth mentioning. Some users have mentioned that out-of-the-box retention can be too tight but can be easily adjusted via screws. Adding or removing from your normal belt may also be difficult due to a fixed secondary security lock piece - though this isn't an issue if you're using a two-sided belt instead.

Overall, I highly recommend this product as it has provided fast draw capabilities and secure retention during intense training sessions and competitions alike, making it reliable and durable in construction at the same time!

### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for FN FNX-45 Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fnh-fnx-45-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-fn-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster has proven to be a reliable and durable option for my FN FNX-45 Tactical. Its high-quality construction, crafted from Boltaron in the USA, provides a precise and secure fit that I can trust on the range or in competition.

One of my favorite features of this holster is the adjustable retention screws. These allow me to customize the level of security between my firearm and the holster with ease. Additionally, the optic ready speed cut design provides me with an edge during competitions by enabling quick clearance of the muzzle out of the holster. It's no surprise that both IDPA and USPSA have legalized this product for use in their competitions, further showcasing its effectiveness.

Another great aspect of this holster is its modular mounting holes which provide versatility when tailoring it to my specific draw and ride preferences using Blade-Tech's compatible attachments. The positive locking trigger guard also offers tactile feedback while storing my firearm safely throughout the day without any concerns about accidental exposure or loss.

However, there were some minor issues when initially setting up this product as some adjustment screws spun freely instead of securing into place once set up according to desired positioning - something which was resolved through customer support assistance via email correspondences within a reasonable timeframe nevertheless. Despite these small hiccups, overall –this remains a solid choice worth considering for those looking for reliable carry options.

### [Custom Kydex OWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/custom-owb-covert-kydex-pistol-mag-holster-cg-holsters-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tested the C&G Covert OWB kydex holster, and I must say, it's one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've tried. The adjustable retention screw lets you customize how tightly your gun fits, ensuring a smooth draw when needed while keeping your gun secure. The geometry of this holster works well to keep my firearm in place without causing discomfort or chafing during extended periods of wear.

In terms of design, the sleek appearance and durability provided by the kydex material make it an excellent choice for everyday use. The belt clip is also comfortable enough for all-day wear while keeping my gun close to my body. This holster can fit a wide variety of firearms and light combinations, making it an incredibly versatile option for concealed carry.

Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for a reliable and comfortable concealed carry solution that balances functionality with comfort.

### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD 3](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Springfield XD 3" extensively, I can confidently vouch for its durability and exceptional build quality. Made from a strong polymer blend, this holster is designed to last. Its IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut ensures quick muzzle clearance, while the precision molded design provides a perfect fit for my firearm.

Although it shares similar features with the Classic OWB Holster at a lower price point, it isn't without its flaws. Some users have reported difficulty in unlocking the secondary lock during action-packed situations like USPSA competitions - an area where improvement could be made in future versions. Additionally, some users noted issues with retention adjustment requiring screws - an easier method could be considered for future models as well.

On the positive side, this holster offers many attachment options to meet various requirements. The positive locking trigger guard also keeps my firearm secure during rigorous training sessions. With its versatile mounting pattern and compatibility with our wide range of attachments, it's no surprise that this holster is a favorite among competitive shooters.

Overall, while there are some areas that could be improved, I still consider this holster to be a reliable option for carrying outside the waistband given its performance relative to its price point.

### [E2 Series Roto-Paddle Holster - Secure Comfortable Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fobus-usa-e2-series-roto-paddle-holster-ruger-sr22-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fobus-usa-e2-series-roto-paddle-holster-ruger-sr22-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Fobus USA E2 Series Roto Paddle Holster for some time, I have to say that it has quickly become one of my preferred holsters. With its steel-reinforced rivet attachment and tension adjustment screw, the holster provides customizable security and presentation that ensures your firearm stays securely in place.

One of the most impressive features of this holster is its ability to rotate 360 degrees with 40 possible positions, allowing for personalized draw angles which are perfect for anyone needing versatility in their carry options. Additionally, the holster has a rubberized paddle insert offering remarkable stability and comfort, making it an excellent option for both left- and right-handed users.

The sleek black finish not only looks great but also feels smooth to the touch. Overall, I've found this holster to be a fantastic value at its price point and would highly recommend it to others looking for a comfortable yet secure carrying option. But keep in mind; some users have mentioned that they experienced difficulty reholstering their firearms due to the retention tension being too tight – something worth considering when deciding if this product is right for you!

### [Ultimate Belly Band Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-left-hand-draw-size-large-black-deep-concealment-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-left-hand-draw-size-large-black-deep-concealment-edition-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the ComfortTac The Ultimate Belly Band Holster for a few months now, and it has quickly become my preference for concealed carry. When I first heard about this holster, I was a bit hesitant to try it out because of past experiences with other belly band holsters that were uncomfortable or had poor retention. However, this ComfortTac holster proved me wrong with its superior qualities.

One aspect that makes this holster stand out from others is its versatility when it comes to carrying positions. Depending on the situation and outfit, I can easily adjust the position of my firearm without having to compromise on comfort or security. The retention strap does an excellent job of keeping the gun in place during movement, and the snap-release feature allows for quick and smooth drawing when needed.

What particularly impressed me about this concealed carry option is how comfortable it feels even during hot summer days. Unlike other belly band holsters made from less breathable materials, this one is crafted using breathable neoprene that prevents sweatiness and irritation. Additionally, the built-in pocket provides extra storage for essentials like my phone or keys.

Overall, I am very pleased with my experience with ComfortTac The Ultimate Belly Band Holster, so much so that I highly recommend it to those looking for a reliable and comfortable carry solution. While there might be some minor improvements to be made in terms of sizing options or design tweaks, the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks in my opinion!

### [Adjustable Retention Modular System Holster for Versatile Carry Options](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="a-r-m-s-holster-holster-only-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/a-r-m-s-holster-holster-only-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to test out the A. R. M. S. Holster by CrossBreed Holsters, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations! The multiple points of retention adjustment feature allows me to tweak the tightness of my gun's pocket, ensuring that it stays secure while still being accessible when needed.

One aspect that I particularly appreciate is the holster's compatibility with various carrying options such as belts, purses, and bags through its hook Velcro on the back. This makes switching between different modes of carry a breeze without having to purchase separate holsters for each purpose. Furthermore, the leather backer provides an extra layer of comfort while carrying against your body or within bags/purses.

The lifetime warranty and two-week 'Try It Free Guarantee' are great indicators of CrossBreed's confidence in their product and its durability. Overall, I am highly impressed with the performance and adaptability of this holster and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable carrying solution.

### [Custom Printed Kydex Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uspsa-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="topographic-orange-custom-printed-holster-iwb-kydex-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-adjustable-sec-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/topographic-orange-custom-printed-holster-iwb-kydex-holster-by-we-the-people-holsters-adjustable-sec-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a custom-designed and printed holster made from durable kydex, and I must say I'm impressed with the craftsmanship and functionality. The snap-in fit for my weapon is rock-solid, providing excellent security. The adjustable cant and ride are very comfortable, making it easy to conceal my weapon without feeling weighed down by the lightweight material.

However, one area where this holster could use some improvement is in its options for left-handed shooters. There aren't many left side carry options available, which can be limiting for some users.

Overall, I would still highly recommend this holster to right-handed shooters who are in search of a reliable, sturdy option that provides optimal concealment and protection. Just keep in mind that it might not be ideal for lefties.

The patent-pending hinge system conforms well to the body during movement, providing optimal comfort. Additionally, there's a light wing that provides extra concealment under clothing, which is particularly useful when wearing more form-fitting clothes.
