### [Custom Mod1 IWB Kydex Holster System for Faxon FX-19](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardini-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardini-holsters&utm_term=custom-mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-for-faxon-fx-19)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/cardini-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=cardini-holsters&utm_term=mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-faxon-fx-20"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-faxon-fx-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-faxon-fx-20/public"/></a></div>

After using the C&G Mod 1 Kydex Holster for a few weeks, I'm incredibly impressed with its quality and design. The hinge system is a game-changer, providing maximum concealment and comfort while carrying my firearm. The holster fits my pistol securely, without any wiggle room, thanks to the proprietary molds and CNC milling that result in precise detailing. The solid locking mechanism provides an audible "click" when the firearm is holstered, giving me peace of mind about weapon security during physical activity.

What I appreciate most about this holster is how well it conforms to my body during movements, ensuring optimal comfort throughout the day. Although I wish I had discovered this holster sooner to save time and money from trying other inferior options on the market, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a high-quality kydex holster.

One area where there may be room for improvement would be adding versatility in terms of fitting different types of guns or adjustability options based on specific user preferences. Other than that minor suggestion, the C&G Mod 1 Kydex Holster has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort, and concealment.

One standout feature is the tension screw adjustment, which allows for a custom fit to my handgun. This level of precision is impressive and ensures a perfect fit every time. My only minor complaint would be the long waiting time I experienced when ordering online initially, but the customer service team was very helpful in addressing this issue.

As a reviewer who has used the Beretta M9A3 Kydex holster by C&G Holsters, I'm happy to say that it exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Kydex material and craftsmanship is top-notch, evident as soon as you hold this holster in your hands. It fits my Beretta M9A3 snugly and securely, allowing for smooth draws with ease.

The retention on the holster is outstanding; there's no wobble or movement of the gun when inserted, yet it releases with just enough resistance to ensure its security until needed. Additionally, the design allows for easy concealment without any discomfort.

What really impressed me was the attention to detail in the finish quality of this holster's edges and overall design. I have owned several Kydex holsters from different manufacturers before, but none have come close to matching the precision and care put into making this one by C&G Holsters.

While there are no major cons with this product, one suggestion for improvement could be offering an option for a QLS attachment as well as smaller belt loop sizes for those who prefer narrower belts. However, these minor points don't take away from how fantastic this product is overall. Based on my experience with this holster, I would highly recommend C&G Holsters to anyone searching for a high-quality Kydex holster that delivers in both performance and comfort!

I recently purchased the C&G Holsters FNX 45 Tactical OWB Covert Kydex Holster for my FNX 45 Tactical pistol, and I am impressed with its quality. The fit and finish are superb, providing a snug yet comfortable hold for my gun. The retention is perfect, allowing me to draw smoothly while keeping my weapon firmly in place. One great feature is the quick-ship option that is very convenient.

The minimalistic design makes it easy to conceal under clothing without being uncomfortable. Also, communication from C&G Holsters has a relaxed tone that adds a personal touch showing they care about customer satisfaction.

This holster provides top-notch craftsmanship by Veterans and Law Enforcement personnel who guarantee it for life - outstanding assurance of quality! Its proprietary molds and CNC milling ensure precision fitting that can't be beaten by other brands on the market today; not to mention how comfortable it feels when wearing due to its ergonomic design features like custom leather belt loops instead of nylon webbing found elsewhere online where prices might vary greatly between different retailers selling similar products but lacking some key ingredients necessary when looking into purchasing such items as these here at CGHolsters dot com/fnx_45_tactical_owb_covert_kydex_holster/.

Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable kydex holster for their FNX 45 Tactical pistol - you won't be disappointed! And with excellent customer service and fast shipping options available too - what more could you ask for? However, it would have been helpful if there was more information on how to adjust the retention pressure or any potential drawbacks or areas for improvement in the holster itself.

The adjustable ride and cant add even more flexibility to the carry options, while the protective sweat guard minimizes contact between my gun and body - preventing any accidental contact with the trigger. The secure belt clip ensures smooth draws every time, making it an essential aspect of this holster's design. Another added advantage is that it's compatible with red dots on standard pistol sights.
