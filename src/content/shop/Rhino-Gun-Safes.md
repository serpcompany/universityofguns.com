<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/winchester-36-long-gun-e-lock-gun-safe-gray-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. As a gun enthusiast, I needed a safe that could not only protect my long guns but also keep them organized. The Winchester safe has exceeded my expectations in terms of storage, accessibility, and security.

One of the most impressive features of this safe is its 45-minute fire rating, which means it can withstand temperatures up to 1400°F for 45 minutes. This gives me peace of mind knowing that my valuable firearms and possessions will be protected in case of a fire emergency.

The spacious interior of the safe is perfect for accommodating up to 26 long guns, making it an ideal choice for both gun enthusiasts and collectors alike. The adjustable shelves and door organizer provide ample storage options for handguns and other valuables, ensuring that everything is easily accessible when needed.

Another great thing about the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe is its electronic lock, which ensures secure access to your firearms. Additionally, the override key provides a reliable backup in case of emergencies.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this safe. Some users have reported that the door may have some play in it once it's closed and locked, but this doesn't detract from the overall security provided by the locking mechanism.

Overall, I highly recommend the Winchester 26 Long Gun Safe to anyone in need of a reliable, secure, and well-organized gun safe. Its steel construction, fire rating, and accessibility features make it a top choice in its price range.

### [Revere 64 Gun Safe with Fire Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="revere-64-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revere-64-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to check out the Liberty Revere 64-gun safe and it's been quite the journey, to say the least. This mighty beast offers excellent security with its 2-piece roll-formed body and 4-inch military-style locking bars, making it a solid choice for storing your prized possessions.

The Revere 64 features a beautiful bronze powder coat finish, and it proudly displays the American flag on its exterior. It's worth mentioning that the build quality is quite impressive, giving me the confidence that my valuables are well-protected.

However, there are a couple of cons that came with this safe. First off, the LED lighting is quite the ordeal to install initially, but once you've got it sorted, it does a great job of brightening up the interior. Additionally, the instructions, though not the best, aren't exactly difficult to decipher.

The other main issue I had was with the locking mechanism. The default combination seemed to malfunction a few times, causing me quite a headache. Thankfully, Liberty's customer service comes to the rescue - they were super helpful in guiding me through fixing the issue.

In conclusion, the Liberty Revere 64-gun safe is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking for a secure and sturdy solution to store their valued belongings.

Just be prepared for a potential learning curve when it comes to the lock and LED installation process!

### [24-Gun ProVault Flex Safe for Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rhino-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

The Flex shelving system definitely stands out, allowing you to customize the interior to fit your specific storage needs, whether for long-guns or a combination of firearms and other valuables. The door panel offers extra storage for handguns and additional valuables, further enhancing its versatility.

On the downside, the spot-welded rear plate could be a concern for some users, as mentioned in certain reviews. Additionally, some reviewers mentioned that certain features, like the door panel, can limit the number of long-guns you can store depending on their optics.

From my experience, the safe is well built, easy to use, and offers peace of mind that your firearms are securely stored. The electronic lock is straightforward to set up and has a 5-year warranty, which adds an extra layer of security.

In summary, the ProVault Flex Loaded 24-Gun Safe by Liberty offers an excellent balance of features, security, and affordability for those looking for a reliable gun safe. Just be aware of the potential limitations in terms of storage capacity, especially if you have longer barreled firearms with scopes.

To my amazement, the safe didn't even flinch, showing me just how durable and robust it truly is. Its 54-gun capacity also means I won't have to scramble to find space for my expanding collection.

However, there's a downside - the massive size and weight of this safe. It's 1300 pounds of solid steel, meaning getting it into your house can be quite the challenge. But that's a small price to pay for the peace of mind this safe provides.

The capacity of this safe is incredible, accommodating up to 40 long guns and 8 handguns. The fully carpeted interior not only enhances the visual appeal but also ensures my guns are protected from scratches.

One feature that stands out is the UL approved power outlet. It's such a convenient feature, especially when I need to charge my phone or power a light inside the safe. I also appreciate the inclusion of a door organizer and the sturdy, steel-reinforced top shelf.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The installation process was a bit of a challenge due to lack of clear instructions on how to install the side locking bolts. Additionally, the delivery cost was quite steep, which was unexpected after seeing the product price.

All in all, the Sports Afield SA5940P Preserve Series Gun Safe offers excellent protection, ample storage, and durability. Although the initial setup could be improved, it meets my needs perfectly and has quickly become an essential part of my home.
