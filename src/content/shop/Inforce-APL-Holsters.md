### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD 3](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/inforce-apl-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=inforce-apl-holsters&utm_term=blade-tech-signature-owb-holster-for-springfield-xd-3)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/inforce-apl-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=inforce-apl-holsters&utm_term=springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1"><img alt="springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-3-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-sprin-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Springfield XD 3" extensively, I can confidently vouch for its durability and exceptional build quality. Made from a strong polymer blend, this holster is designed to last. Its IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut ensures quick muzzle clearance, while the precision molded design provides a perfect fit for my firearm.

Although it shares similar features with the Classic OWB Holster at a lower price point, it isn't without its flaws. Some users have reported difficulty in unlocking the secondary lock during action-packed situations like USPSA competitions - an area where improvement could be made in future versions. Additionally, some users noted issues with retention adjustment requiring screws - an easier method could be considered for future models as well.

On the positive side, this holster offers many attachment options to meet various requirements. The positive locking trigger guard also keeps my firearm secure during rigorous training sessions. With its versatile mounting pattern and compatibility with our wide range of attachments, it's no surprise that this holster is a favorite among competitive shooters.

Overall, while there are some areas that could be improved, I still consider this holster to be a reliable option for carrying outside the waistband given its performance relative to its price point.

I recently purchased the FNX 45 Tactical holster from CG Holsters and have been blown away by its quality and performance. Made from durable Kydex material, this holster is both sturdy and comfortable, providing a perfect blend of protection and concealment. The open bottom design accommodates threaded barrels and compensators, a feature that sets it apart from other holsters on the market.

The retention system is top-notch, with an audible click indicating that your firearm is securely in place. Drawing my gun from the holster feels smooth and natural, without any snags or issues during practice sessions at the range. Additionally, their customer service team is highly responsive and helpful when it comes to sizing/fitment questions.

While there isn't much room for improvement with this product, I would have liked to see more color options available for a more personalized touch. Overall, I highly recommend the FNX 45 Tactical holster for its superior quality, comfort, and reliability in securing your firearm.

As a recent user of the [Product Name], I must say it has been a remarkable experience. The moment I put it on, I was instantly impressed by how well it hugged my body contour at the 3 o'clock position, even when using just a blue jeans belt loop between the holster loops. The attention to detail in molding is evident from how snugly it fits my Smith & Wesson firearm.

One feature that stood out was the level of comfort and concealment offered, which is something that hasn’t been experienced before with any other kydex holster. The custom C&G 1. 75” belt loops have also made it easy for me to adjust the holster according to my preference without compromising its retention abilities. The open bottom design allows for seamless fitment with threaded barrels and compensators from various brands like Tyrant, Agency, Zev, PMM etc. , adding another positive point to this product!

However, there were a few cons such as initial confusion due to a slight difference in color from what was mentioned in the product description; being 'black in color'. Additionally, while there are numerous highlighted features like solid locking retention and proprietary molds that add value to this product; these features weren’t immediately apparent until after extended usage - they could be better showcased upfront for potential customers making informed decisions about investing into this impressive product lineup from [Company Name].

Overall though despite these minor issues - my experience using this American-made kydex holster has been fantastic! With its guaranteed lifetime warranty and excellent customer service provided by Veterans/Law Enforcement personnel ensuring perfection and precision through their proprietary molds and CNC milling process; you can expect nothing but top quality craftsmanship perfect for your firearm needs.

I was thrilled to try out the Inforce APL Holsters for my 1911. The Kydex construction is top-notch, providing strength and durability. I appreciate the design that caters specifically to TLR1 and TLR1HL, ensuring efficient functionality.

The open bottom allows for a comfortable fit with various threaded barrels and compensators, and the built-in wedge enhances deployment and comfort. The tall sight channel works well with Red Dot/Suppressor height models, too.

The audible and tactile ‘click’ of the locking retention mechanism gives me peace of mind knowing my weapon is securely holstered, while the proprietary molds and CNC milled process ensure precision and a level of concealment like never before from a Kydex holster.

Overall, I've had a great experience using these highly-rated holsters – 4. 9 stars out of 13 reviews – which are also made in America by Veterans and Law Enforcement personnel. They're comfortable to wear – whether you have a Trijicon RMR or other compatible red dot sights – easy to draw from, and provide ample security for your weapon. Highly recommended!

Plus, the customizable belt loops made it easy to find the perfect fit. My only minor issue was that I had to shave down the inside of the holster due to my compensator being too big, but overall this is a fantastic product combining safety and comfort. If you're looking for a high-quality holster, I highly recommend giving this one a try!

The build quality is top-notch; it is made of durable materials, and the craftsmanship is impeccable. The retention is perfect - not so tight that it's difficult to draw, but secure enough that you don't have to worry about your pistol dislodging itself.

The fitment was spot-on; my pistol fits perfectly in the holster while accommodating most red dots and sight heights.
