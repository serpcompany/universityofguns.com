I recently purchased the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Sig P365, and have been quite impressed with its performance. The slim design makes it easy to conceal, even when wearing light clothing. One of the most significant features is the high sweat guard, which keeps my firearm off my body and prevents any discomfort from moisture or slide serrations.

The belt clip that comes with the holster is an innovative addition; it allows you to secure it in place on your belt up to 1. 5" until you need to remove it, a feature that I have found very useful. Additionally, I really appreciate the built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard - these provide tangible feedback to ensure that my firearm is securely stored in place.

Overall, this product exceeded all expectations; it is comfortable throughout the day as well as providing peace of mind knowing that my firearm is securely tucked away until needed. This holster has become a go-to in my EDC routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable IWB option for their Sig P365 / P365X!

The soft, supple leather backing of this holster molds to the body shape, providing a custom-like fit without any discomfort or irritation.
