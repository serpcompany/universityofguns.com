### [Truglo AC Range Rover Black Sight with Infinite Brightness Settings](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=truglo-ac-range-rover-black-sight-with-infinite-brightness-settings)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=truglo-ac-range-rover-019-black-sight-1"><img alt="truglo-ac-range-rover-019-black-sight-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-ac-range-rover-019-black-sight-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Truglo AC Range Rover. 019 Black Sight, and it's been a game-changer for my target shooting experience. The first thing that struck me was how easy it was to set up. The tool-less yardage lock and smooth bracket movement made it incredibly user-friendly, even for someone like me who's not particularly tech-savvy. 

One of the standout features of this sight is its adjustable rheostat, which allows for infinite brightness settings. This was a lifesaver when I found myself in low-light shooting scenarios, ensuring that I always had a clear view of my target. In addition, the replaceable batteries ensure that I can keep shooting without having to worry about running out of power mid-session. 

However, there are a few minor cons to consider. Some users reported issues with the screws provided, as they were quite brittle and prone to breaking. Additionally, a few left-handed users found it difficult to adjust the sight to their needs, as the mounting holes are only beveled on one side. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall experience with the Truglo AC Range Rover. 019 Black Sight has been overwhelmingly positive. Its durability, ease of use, and adaptability make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their target shooting skills.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=truglo-range-rover-ac-micro-sight-1"><img alt="truglo-range-rover-ac-micro-sight-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-range-rover-ac-micro-sight-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Truglo Range Rover AC Micro Sight and ever since, my archery game has truly improved. The tool-less yardage lock feature has made adjustments a breeze and the clean, circular sight picture with the all-metal pin has allowed for more accurate shots. 

The extra-long, fully protected wrapped fiber allows for a reliable performance while the ultra-smooth bracket ensures easy one-hand adjustments, saving me a lot of time during practice sessions. Not to mention, the sight housing accepts a 1.87" scope lens, which I found to be a nice addition, although it's sold separately. 

One of my favorite features also happens to be one of the most efficient ones - the 40+ pre-marked yardage tapes for a simplified setup. Plus, the adjustable yardage-stop helps cater to my maximum yardage setting perfectly. 

Although there's no mount included, I didn't face any issues. The quiver can be mounted directly onto the bracket, simplifying things even further. Speaking of the quiver, it also comes with a quiver mount for added convenience. Overall, the Truglo Range Rover AC Micro Sight has been a game-changer in my archery journey, providing a sturdy and reliable shooting experience. If you're looking for a high-quality bow sight, this one definitely shouldn't be missed!

I recently came across the Truglo AC-4 Range Rover Sight, and it's quickly become my go-to bow sight. Why, you ask? . Well, unlike traditional bow sights, the AC-4 can be locked in place as a multi-pin sight, or easily dialed in to whatever distance I'm shooting. 

It's like having two sights in one! . Plus, the pre-printed yardage tapes are super easy to calibrate, whether you're using the top pin or the bottom one. And the best part? .

### [Microtune Sight for Q-4 Magpul Iron](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=microtune-sight-for-q-4-magpul-iron)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=viper-driver-q-4-microtune-dovetail-sight-4pin-015-rh-lh-1"><img alt="viper-driver-q-4-microtune-dovetail-sight-4pin-015-rh-lh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viper-driver-q-4-microtune-dovetail-sight-4pin-015-rh-lh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Viper Driver Q-4 Microtune Dovetail Sight, and I have to say, it's a game-changer. I've been using it in my hunting expeditions, and I must say that the RAP gear drive system is a real treat. It's incredibly smooth, and I feel confident knowing that it won't strip out under tension. Adding to that, the sight supports both right-handed and left-handed users, making it a versatile option for everyone. Another feature that caught my eye was the Mathews Bridge Lock mount system that ensures it stays secure no matter how rugged the terrain gets. 

However, one drawback I found was the weight. Though it's not excessively heavy, the added weight could make a difference in long expeditions. Even with this minor inconvenience, the overall experience with the Viper Driver Q-4 Microtune Dovetail Sight has been nothing short of impressive. It's a must-have for anyone looking for a high-performing, reliable, and versatile sight system. 


### [Viper Tactical Series 5000 Single Pin Sight with Second Axis Adjustment](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=viper-tactical-series-5000-single-pin-sight-with-second-axis-adjustment)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/magpul-iron-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=magpul-iron-sights&utm_term=viper-tactical-series-5000-sight-1-pin-019-rh-1"><img alt="viper-tactical-series-5000-sight-1-pin-019-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viper-tactical-series-5000-sight-1-pin-019-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Viper Tactical Series 5000 Sight was a bit of a rollercoaster ride. On one hand, I appreciated the made-in-America quality, as evidenced by the CNC machined 6061 T6 top-grade aluminum construction and stainless-steel hardware. The quickset elevation adjustment was definitely a highlight - just set the ultra-smooth gear-drive star knob to your desired yardage and you're good to go! The 2nd axis adjustment, featuring delrin bushings for a silky-smooth experience, was another positive point. 

However, the product fell short in terms of its visiblity and durability. The single 1 ultra-bright horizontal fiber optic metal pin wasn't as striking as I had hoped, and it felt a tad too fragile for my liking. I didn't have the heart-stopping experience of having the pin snapped off like the reviewer in question did, but I could see how it could be a potential problem for others. The versatile 1.63-inch sight housing did offer some flexibility, but overall, I felt like the product could have been more robust and reliable. 

In conclusion, while the Viper Tactical Series 5000 Sight boasts some innovative features, it may not be the best choice for those looking for a durable and reliable sight. Its quickset elevation adjustment and 2nd axis adjustment certainly make for a more streamlined user experience, but the thinness and fragility of the 1 ultra-bright horizontal fiber optic metal pin could be a major drawback for some. If you're considering this sight for your hunting or competition needs, just make sure you handle it with care to avoid any potential mishaps!
