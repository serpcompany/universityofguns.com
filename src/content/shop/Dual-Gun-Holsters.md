After using the dual position sportsman's holster for my semiautomatic pistol while hiking and camping, I was thoroughly impressed with its versatility and quality construction. The ability to use it either strong side or crossdraw added an extra level of adaptability to different situations.

The premium saddle leather construction with silicone suede lining provides excellent durability and comfort during long hours of wear. What I particularly liked about this holster was the stitched sight rails that protected both the leather and my gun's sights from wear and tear, a common issue with other holsters.

The reinforced thumb break with a covered snap provided me with peace of mind knowing that my weapon would remain secure in dense brush or any challenging terrain. The tension screw adjustment allowed me to achieve the perfect balance between secure retention and a swift draw, making it ideal for quick response situations.

Although there is some initial breaking-in required for the leather, once broken in, the fit becomes even more comfortable and snug for belts up to 1-3/4". This versatile feature ensured that it worked perfectly with most belt styles that I tried.

From my personal experience using this product, I can confidently recommend this Dual Position Phoenix Holster for anyone looking for a reliable, durable, and user-friendly holster for their semiautomatic pistol or double-action revolver. It's definitely worth every penny spent on it!

I've been using the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster in my daily life, and I must say, it's a versatile holster that suits most carrying preferences. The photon is truly ambidextrous and can be configured for outside or inside the waistband use. I appreciate the holster's design, optimized for appendix carry, as it comes with an included appendix carry wing for concealment and an optional sidecar mag carrier.

One feature that stands out for me is its compatibility with compact lights, making it ideal for modern shooters. Another notable aspect is its optic cut, which accommodates almost any optic except the SRO, offering great customization. Made in the USA, the Alien Gear Photon Holster offers a lifetime warranty, adding to its overall appeal.

However, some drawbacks include a bulky design and a difficult clipping mechanism due to the claw and clip sharing the same screws. Moreover, the holster may not be the best choice for individuals whose skill levels and knowledge have evolved, necessitating a more advanced holster.

In conclusion, the Alien Gear Photon Glock 19 Holster offers excellent modularity and practicality. Despite its downsides, it has proven to be a decent option for both new and experienced shooters who seek a reliable and versatile holster.

### [Dual Angle Hunter Hybrid Holster - Ambidextrous Design](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dual-gun-holsters&utm_term=dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-ambidextrous-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dual-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-m90bj34z0-dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-black-rh-1"><img alt="desantis-m90bj34z0-dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-black-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-m90bj34z0-dual-angle-hunter-hybrid-holster-black-rh-1/public"/></a></div>

As a passionate hunter, I've been using the Desantis Dual Angle Hunter Hybrid Holster Black RH for a while now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The first thing that caught my eye was its unique blend of materials - the 1060D Senior Ballistic Nylon adds durability and strength, while the premium saddle leather adds a touch of sophistication and comfort.

The real winning feature of this holster, in my opinion, is its ambidextrous nature. As a left-handed shooter, I often find myself struggling with right-handed oriented products. However, with the Hunter Hybrid, there were no adjustments needed - it worked perfectly for both my left and right hands.

One downside I noticed was the initial tightness of the holster. It took a few uses to properly break in and loosen up, but once that happened, it became a near-perfect fit for my gun.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. It's comfortable, stylish, and best of all, versatile enough to suit my needs no matter which hand I choose to shoot with. If you're in the market for a high-quality holster, look no further than the Desantis Dual Angle Hunter Hybrid Holster Black RH.

### [Tuckable Dual IWB Holster for Glock 19-23-32-36](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dual-gun-holsters&utm_term=tuckable-dual-iwb-holster-for-glock-19-23-32-36)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/dual-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=dual-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-dual-carry-ii-holster-fits-glock-19-23-32-37"><img alt="desantis-dual-carry-ii-holster-fits-glock-19-23-32-37" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-dual-carry-ii-holster-fits-glock-19-23-32-37/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Desantis Dual Carry II Holster, specifically designed to fit my Glock 23. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a real game-changer! The adjustable 'C' clip allows me to tuck in my shirt while keeping the metal clip visible for a seamless concealed carry look. Plus, the soft non-molded leather offers comfort and quality I haven't found in other holsters.

One major highlight of this holster is its ability to accommodate various guns, including the Glock 19, 23, 32, and 36. It's really convenient to switch between different firearms without needing separate holsters. However, I must admit that it does ride a bit high, which may cause discomfort while sitting.

The overall quality of this holster is undoubtedly top-notch. The leather feels sturdy and well-made, and the thumb break feature offers added security. But there is a small downside - the plastic clip could be more durable. I had a minor issue with the J clip, as it doesn't seem as strong as I would like.

In conclusion, the Desantis Dual Carry II Holster has been an excellent addition to my daily carry setup. Its adjustable design is perfect for both IWB and OWB carry options, and its ability to fit multiple Glock models is a definite bonus. While there are some minor drawbacks, the pros far outweigh the cons, making this holster a worthwhile investment for those looking for reliable protection and easy concealment.

- Retention: A good dual gun holster should offer secure retention to prevent accidental discharge or unauthorized access. Models with adjustable retention are ideal, as they allow you to set the level of retention that you're comfortable with.

- Concealment: If you plan on carrying your dual gun holster concealed, look for models with a slim profile and adjustable cant to help you achieve the desired level of concealment without sacrificing comfort or accessibility.

- Accessibility: Ensuring that your weapons are easily accessible is crucial. A dual gun holster with a proper balance of speed and security can help you achieve this.

- Nylon: Lightweight, water-resistant, and cost-effective, nylon is a good choice for those on a budget. However, it may not offer the same degree of retention or adjustability as more premium materials like leather or Kydex.

### Proper Fit and Customization

Many dual gun holsters are available in different sizes or configurations to accommodate various handgun models. Some holsters offer adjustable retention and cant, allowing you to fine-tune the fit and function to your liking.

### Maintenance and Care

Proper maintenance and care of your dual gun holster will help prolong its life and maintain its functionality. Regularly inspect your holster for signs of wear or damage, and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for cleaning and care.
