One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-core-car-pack-rh-sw-mp-c-9-40-black-1/public"/></a></div>

As a daily user of the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Car Pack for my S&W M&P C 9/40 Black, I can confidently say that this versatile holster system has been a game-changer. The Starter Kit includes everything you need to transform the holster into an IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle holster, making it incredibly adaptable to various situations.

One of its most impressive features is the Holster Mount, which allows you to attach the holster to a variety of surfaces quickly and securely. The IWB Holster is incredibly comfortable and concealable, thanks to its CoolVent neoprene base and stainless-steel core. The ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster is a step up from other options in its category, with a single mounting feature that enhances concealability and a breathable neoprene back that makes carrying AIWB natural.

### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

### [Hybrid Holster for Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-hybrid-holster-spg-hellcat-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer when it comes to carrying my handgun. This hybrid holster combines the best of both worlds - the precision and secure retention of Kydex with the comfort and natural feel of authentic American full-grain leather.

What really stood out to me was the adjustable cant feature, which allowed me to change the angle of my holster between 0-15 degrees for a perfect fit. The ambidextrous hole patterns made it easy for both right and left-handed users to find the perfect position to carry their gun. And as someone who constantly wears a holster, the comfort level it provides is unmatched.

The holster is also RMR compatible, meaning you can easily attach an additional red dot sight for increased accuracy. The 1.5" belt clip ensures a secure connection to your belt, and the adjustable retention with an audible click offers peace of mind every time you draw and re-holster your weapon.

However, there are a couple of cons I want to address. I experienced some issues with the screws coming loose, especially during intense activities like running or jumping. Additionally, I noticed that the holster tends to wear out faster than expected, making it less durable than I initially hoped.

Overall, the Mission First Tactical Hybrid Holster SPG Hellcat Black offers a comfortable and versatile solution for concealed carry. While it does have some room for improvement in terms of screw durability and overall longevity, I believe that this holster is definitely worth considering for those looking for a reliable everyday carry option.

### [Magnetic Gun Holder for Under Desk, Car, Home, or Office](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-steering-wheel-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this super-versatile Gun Magnet to store and conceal my handguns. One of the highlights is the powerful magnetic force that securely holds various sizes of handguns, even compact ones. It's quick and easy to mount this magnetic holder anywhere, from my car to your bedside. The specific plastic coating ensures your gun doesn't get scratched while being stored.

However, the hard and slippery plastic poses a bit of a problem, as it doesn't hold the gun as steadily as I'd like, especially when using it in a vehicle. Additionally, the magnet may not be strong enough for larger firearms like rifles and shotguns.

In terms of quality, the magnetic holder boasts superior weatherproof and shockproof construction. It's easy to set up and even allows for quickdraws in emergencies. One potential drawback is its hard plastic finish, which can be a bit slippery and may not hold your gun as securely as you'd prefer.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am overall satisfied with the Gun Magnet's performance and find it helpful for concealed gun storage. The powerful magnets make it easy to attach and remove my handguns, making for a convenient and secure storage solution.
