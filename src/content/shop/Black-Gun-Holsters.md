### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

Additionally, the chest configuration ensures that my handgun remains free from debris and obstructions, making it easy to draw and reholster quickly when necessary.

However, there is one minor inconvenience I've encountered with the Warden: the adjustment process can be a bit cumbersome. While the holster's compatibility with multiple firearms is undoubtedly a bonus, swapping between different guns can be time-consuming and requires a bit of finesse.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/black-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

The adjustable angle and height truly made it customizable to my preference, allowing me to perform to the best of my ability during competitions.

I especially liked how this holster is approved in 3Gun, IPSC, and USPSA, which means it's trusted and recognized by these major organizations. The fact that it's an outside-the-waistband drop-and-offset design was also a huge plus for me since it offers quick draw access when it matters most.

The only downside I noticed was that the belt loop/slot attachment mount type could be slightly more secure. One of my friends had a minor issue with it during a practice session, but overall, the holster performed admirably under rigorous conditions.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Staccato C2 Pro Competition Holster to anyone looking to upgrade their gear for competitive shooting. This holster is a reliable and feature-rich option that will help you achieve your potential in the sport.

I feel secure with it, and it's super comfortable to wear too. The black color is a nice touch, nothing too flashy but still looks cool.

Now, one downside is that it's priced on the higher side, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny. Another small inconvenience is that it does take a little time to get used to the draw, but once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing.

Overall, I'm really happy with my Staccato Competition Holster. It's made my sport shooting experiences much safer and more comfortable. If you're looking for a reliable and comfortable holster for your right hand, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a shot!
