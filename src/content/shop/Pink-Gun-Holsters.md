I recently had the chance to test out the C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB, and it has quickly become one of my favorite holsters. The custom craftsmanship ensures a perfect fit for your specific needs, making it both comfortable and effective in daily use.

One feature I found particularly useful was the Open Bottom design that fits threaded barrels and compensators perfectly. This is something not all holsters can do, so it's a big plus for me. Another great aspect is the Custom Dark Wing, which offers added concealment and helps minimize any printing while carrying my firearm.

In terms of security, the solid locking retention provides a secure hold on my gun with a tactile click when holstered to let you know it's locked in place. This gives me great peace of mind while carrying. Additionally, comfort is a top priority with this holster due to its patent-pending hinge system that conforms to body movements during activities like bending or squatting.

The. 093" thickness combined with precision CNC manufacturing (to within. 003 inches! ) makes for excellent durability with minimal added weight for comfortable all-day carry. Plus, all hardware has an added Salt bath Nitriding treatment for increased strength and rust/corrosion prevention - so you know it can handle whatever comes its way!

I did experience some difficulties installing the extra mag carrier at first but their customer support was quick to respond over email with clear instructions that helped resolve the issue promptly - not enough for me to deduct from my rating or recommendation at all! Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality custom-crafted Kydex IWB holster that delivers on comfort, concealment and security – look no further than C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB!

After using the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for my Ruger LCP for a few weeks, I have to say it's become my go-to holster. The slim and discreet design makes it easy to carry every day, and the high sweat guard effectively keeps my firearm off my body, providing comfort throughout the day.

One of the features that stands out is how securely the belt clip keeps the holster in place - it stays put until you're ready to remove it. Additionally, with built-in retention and a positive lock trigger guard, I can rest assured that my firearm remains secure without any adjustments needed.

The smooth edges and full-length sweat guard provide all-day comfort even when wearing against bare skin. However, one area for improvement could be the durability of the material used in manufacturing; though it appears sturdy at first glance, over time there might be some wear and tear. Nonetheless, this product has quickly become an essential part of my everyday carry setup because of its simplicity and effectiveness. It provides me with confidence in knowing that I can access my Ruger LCP whenever needed while also ensuring that it remains safely secured throughout the day.

The build quality is excellent and feels durable enough to last a long time. It features a unique hinge mechanism, front brace, side claw, and adjustable clips which enhance its functionality.
