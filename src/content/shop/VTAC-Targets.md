I've been using Action Targets in my shooting practice sessions, and I'm blown away by their quality.

The VTAC Double Sided Paper Marksmanship/Silhouette Targets have quickly become a go-to for my shooting practice sessions. The standout feature of this product is its versatility, with two different target styles on one sheet. This space-saving design saves me money and allows for easy transitions between marksmanship and self-defense training.

I like the extra heavy sheet of bright white paper that makes the targets durable and highly visible even in tough conditions. On one side of the target, there's a silhouette with a visible skeleton which helps me accurately work on shot placement for self-defense purposes. On the other side, there are 40 SR-1C bull's-eye targets with a 1" square sighting grid layout - perfect for honing accuracy skills when using handguns or long guns at varying distances.

### [2-Sided VTAC Target Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="action-target-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-target-2-sided-by-v-tac-100pk-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Action Target 2-Sided by V-Tac, a 100-pack of versatile and durable targets perfect for shooting enthusiasts and professionals alike. These targets are designed to meet the needs of commercial range owners, law enforcement, and military personnel.

In my experience with the Action Targets, the thing that stood out to me the most was their ability to provide a variety of challenges on the same paper. The unique design of these targets allows for numerous exercises that help hone my skills, whether it be sighting in a rifle or participating in a 3-gun competition.

Another key feature that I appreciated was the use of light-colored paper for the targets. This made marking each activity with a marker incredibly easy, allowing me to keep track of my progress from session to session. It even made it easier to see new rounds hitting their mark on the target.

However, there is one minor drawback I've encountered while using these targets. The pricing seems a bit steep when compared to some other options on the market. That being said, the quality and versatility of the Action Targets make them well worth the investment for anyone serious about improving their shooting skills.

### [NRA B16 Slow Fire Pistol Target 40722](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-targets-nra-b16-40723" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-targets-nra-b16-40723/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Champion Traps and Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire target for my home practice sessions, and it has been an excellent addition to my range kit. This target, measuring 10.5" x 12", is the perfect size for practicing trigger squeeze and sight alignment with various firearms. As it is an official NRA target, I feel confident that I am improving my skills with a standardized, high-quality tool.

The available models include competition, silhouette, police pistol, training, and qualification targets, making it suitable for both hobbyist shooters and professionals alike. As a beginner, I have found the training targets particularly useful, as they range from practice to advanced qualification levels.

One of the highlights of this target is its 7-8-9-10 rings black design, which has made my experience at the range more enjoyable and engaging compared to splatter targets or those with lower visibility markings. Additionally, this target closely approximates average slow fire scores at 50 yards, making it an excellent choice for practicing with a variety of firearms.

However, there are a few areas where I feel the target could be improved. The stiff cardstock paper used for the target can become difficult to handle when outside in harsh weather conditions, leading to potential damage and reduced lifespan. Additionally, while the target itself is high-quality, the price may be somewhat discouraging for those on a tighter budget.

In conclusion, the Champion Traps and Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire target is an effective tool for improving your firing accuracy and honing your skills during practice sessions. Despite some minor drawbacks, this product has been a valuable addition to my collection of targets and will continue to serve me well as I progress in my shooting journey.

### [Loud and Safe Rimfire Targets for Explosive Fun](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sonic-boom-exploding-rimfire-target-10-pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sonic-boom-exploding-rimfire-target-10-pk-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Sonic Boom Exploding Rimfire Targets and boy, was I in for a treat! This isn't your average target, it's a fun and satisfying way to enhance your shooting experience.

Sonic Boom has really done their homework with this one. They've used high-quality, non-hazardous, non-toxic chemicals that provide one of the largest explosions and loudest booms I've ever heard from an exploding target. And let me tell you, the sound is half the fun!

The Rimfire Targets are perfect for those closer range shots with lower caliber firearms. With ten (10) individual targets, you'll have plenty of opportunities to show off your skills while enjoying the thrill of each explosion.

Now, let's talk about mixing. It's not the most glamorous part of using these targets, but it's definitely worth it. The two-part mixture is easy to mix and use. Just remember to be safe and keep a distance of at least 100 ft from the exploding target. Also, make sure your projectile is traveling at a minimum of 1100 fps to initiate the explosion.

One thing to keep in mind when using the Rimfire Targets is to use a backstop if you're firing with smaller rimfire calibers such as. 22lr. This will ensure safety and prevent any unwanted accidents.

Overall, I had a blast (pun intended! ) using the Sonic Boom Exploding Rimfire Targets. They are perfect for shotguns and handguns, providing a unique and thrilling shooting experience. Just be prepared for a little mess and time-consuming mixing, but it's all worth it in the end when you hear that satisfying boom!

### [12" AR500 Steel Gong Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/vtac-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="dragon-targets-10x-3-8-gong-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-10x-3-8-gong-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Dragon Targets 10"x 3/8" Gong AR500 Steel Shooting Target, and I'm happy to report that it has been a game-changer for my shooting sessions. The target is made of high-quality AR500 steel, which ensures its durability and longevity - a feature that I undoubtedly appreciated when I accidentally hit it with a stray bullet. The non-reflective painting on the target also eliminates glare, making it easy to shoot even on a bright sunny day.

One of my favorite aspects of this target is its loud "dinging" noise when hit. It's not only satisfying but also lets me know that I'm on point without having to walk downrange to check for strikes. This has significantly increased my shooting efficiency and overall enjoyment of my practice sessions.

However, there are two minor cons to this product. Firstly, the price might seem high for some users. But considering the quality of the materials used and the performance, I believe it's worth the investment. Secondly, the lack of reflectivity on the target can make it difficult to see in low-light conditions. Nevertheless, these cons don't outweigh the benefits provided by this excellent shooting target.

In conclusion, the Dragon Targets AR500 Steel Shooting Target has greatly improved my shooting experience and makes every session more enjoyable and productive. If you're looking to upgrade from paper targets, this is definitely worth considering.
