### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=urban-carry-lockleather-owb-combo-holster-with-magazine-pouch)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=lockleather-owbmag-holster-1"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

I recently purchased the IWB Holster Mount and have been using it daily for a few weeks now. This product has truly transformed my daily carry experience, offering both convenience and peace of mind. The mount securely holds my holstered firearm in place, whether I'm at my office desk or driving in my truck. Its dual locking design provides assurance that the weapon won't fall out, even on bumpy roads.

One feature that stands out to me is how easy it is to transition from wearing the holster to storing it in the mount - all without sacrificing security. While I haven't encountered any issues with exposed triggers or scratched-up pistols before using this product, it offers an extra layer of safety and protection that I appreciate.

I was also impressed by the two unique mounting methods offered by this product, allowing me to find secure spots for both at home and in my vehicle. The only minor issue I encountered was having to slightly modify one of my existing holsters for a proper fit in the mount - a small hindrance easily remedied.

Overall, this IWB Holster Mount is an essential accessory for anyone who carries concealed weapons daily – definitely worth its cost! With its lightweight design and dual locking mechanism, you can rest assured that your firearm remains safe and secure while on-the-go or stored away when not needed.

### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=seizmik-icos-silent-secure-in-cab-seat-gun-holder)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

### [Magnetic Gun Holder for Under Desk, Car, Home, or Office](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=magnetic-gun-holder-for-under-desk-car-home-or-office)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/under-dash-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=under-dash-gun-holsters&utm_term=safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1"><img alt="safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safety-storage-for-gun-storage-gun-magnet-concealed-rifle-shotgun-magnetic-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this super-versatile Gun Magnet to store and conceal my handguns. One of the highlights is the powerful magnetic force that securely holds various sizes of handguns, even compact ones. It's quick and easy to mount this magnetic holder anywhere, from my car to your bedside. The specific plastic coating ensures your gun doesn't get scratched while being stored.

However, the hard and slippery plastic poses a bit of a problem, as it doesn't hold the gun as steadily as I'd like, especially when using it in a vehicle. Additionally, the magnet may not be strong enough for larger firearms like rifles and shotguns.

In terms of quality, the magnetic holder boasts superior weatherproof and shockproof construction. It's easy to set up and even allows for quickdraws in emergencies. One potential drawback is its hard plastic finish, which can be a bit slippery and may not hold your gun as securely as you'd prefer.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am overall satisfied with the Gun Magnet's performance and find it helpful for concealed gun storage. The powerful magnets make it easy to attach and remove my handguns, making for a convenient and secure storage solution.
