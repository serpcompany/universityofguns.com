I recently purchased a 1791 Gunleather 4-Way Holster for my concealed carry needs. The holster is made of high-quality American steerhide leather, which I appreciate as it ensures durability and long-lasting use.

This convenience saves me from having to purchase separate holsters for each gun I own. Additionally, the four different carrying options - inside the waistband, outside the waistband, and both right and left cross draw - provides flexibility in choosing whichever method suits my needs at any given time.

Handcrafted details on the exterior are quite impressive and add a touch of class to an otherwise functional accessory. It's clear that great care was taken in crafting this holster. The interior features hand-finished surfaces that protect my pistol's bluing, an important factor for me as I want to maintain my firearm in pristine condition for as long as possible.

While there were some minor issues with breaking in the leather initially, over time it conformed well to both my body shape and specific firearms (Glock 26/27/33), increasing comfort during daily use while maintaining secure fitment through reinforced stitching even during vigorous movement or activity. Despite being incredibly comfortable after break in period, customer service could have been more helpful with addressing this initial concern on how best approach breaking in period according their recommended methods without risk damaging product or losing warranty coverage due improper usage; however once resolved proved satisfactory overall experience thus far continues be great investment into quality product craftsmanship like no other!
