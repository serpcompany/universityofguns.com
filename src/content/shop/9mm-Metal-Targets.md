<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/9mm-metal-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=9mm-metal-targets&utm_term=cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1"><img alt="cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've been using Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree at my range and it's provided countless hours of fun and challenging gameplay. With a solid steel frame and 8 spring-loaded flip targets, this dueling tree is perfect for practicing my accuracy and having fun with friends.

The sizes range from 1.5" to 3", which makes for an interesting and varied game experience. I've found that the smaller targets require more precise aiming, while the larger ones are slightly easier to hit. With a wide base and stakes, it's extremely stable and stays in place even during our more intense shooting sessions.

One minor downside is that occasionally some of the paddles might get stuck halfway back or bounce back, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I just give them a gentle push to reset and continue my session.

The only real issue I've run into is that the springs connected to the paddles can sometimes feel a bit loose and flimsy. However, I discovered that applying a light coat of lubricant like WD-40 silicone spray resolved this issue.

Overall, I've been thoroughly impressed with Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree's quality, durability, and convenience. It's not only allowed me to improve my shooting skills but also provided a great way to bond with my friends during some intense target practice sessions. I'd definitely recommend investing in one of these dueling trees as it offers exceptional value for its price point and has undoubtedly enhanced my overall shooting experience.

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Targets, and I must say, it's a fun addition to my backyard shooting range. The bright orange color makes it easy to spot from a distance, and the unique spinning mechanism adds a nice challenge.

The best part of this target is its ability to spin around its central axis after being hit, which provides a moving target to practice on. However, I noticed that the axis of the target has changed from a straight to a curved design, which could take some time to get used to.

This target is suitable for use with. 177 airguns or air rifles, but I wouldn't recommend using it with high-power PCP airguns, as it may not handle the impact as well. Before using, it's best to give the targets a good spin by hand to ensure they're properly aligned and functioning correctly.

Overall, the Atflbox Ferris Wheel Metal Resetting Targets are a unique and entertaining addition to any backyard shooting range. While there were a few minor drawbacks, the enjoyable challenge it provides and its bright color make it a worthwhile purchase.

The Crosman Dual Spinning Targets are my go-to for air gun practice sessions. I've been using them with both. 177 and. 22 caliber pellet rifles, and they never disappoint. These compact spinning targets provide the perfect level of challenge, keeping me engaged and improving my skills.

One thing that really stands out is how easy they are to transport and store. Their foldable design makes them a dream to carry around, and they take up very little space when not in use.

Although the size of these targets may seem small, it has only added to the fun for me. Every hit sends the targets spinning with that satisfying "ping! " sound. Plus, the metal frame appears to be extremely durable, giving me confidence that it can withstand countless shots without falling apart.

However, there's one issue that I've noticed - the target decals could use some improvement. They tend to wear out quite quickly, which might become a problem in the long run.

Despite this minor setback, I find the Crosman Dual Spinning Targets incredibly enjoyable and beneficial for practicing my shooting skills.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/9mm-metal-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=universityofguns.com&utm_content=9mm-metal-targets&utm_term=taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1"><img alt="taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taylor-targets-rr-53-5-rimfire-reset-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the Taylor Targets RR-53.5 Rimfire Reset Steel Target for some fun shooting sessions with my family and friends. This target is a game-changer! It comes with four lower 3-2/1 in targets and one upper 3-1/2 in target, which adds to the challenge and enjoyment.

What I really love about this target is the rimfire reset feature. Once all four lower targets flip up, hitting the upper target resets them all back into position. This eliminates the need for me to walk back and manually reset my targets, so I can spend more time shooting. The target is designed for use with rimfire handguns and rifles, 0.22 caliber, and provides shooting action that is easy to see and hear.

Made from heavy-duty steel, the RR-53.5 is built to last and provide years of trouble-free practice. The portable and easy-to-reset design means we can take it with us wherever we go, making it perfect for outings with family and friends.

The only small downside I noticed is that the target might not be able to withstand magnum revolver rounds. However, for regular rimfire handguns and rifles, the RR-53.5 is a fantastic choice that combines excitement, challenge, and portability, all in one package. Highly recommended!
