### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.

### [Versacarry Distressed Brown OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

Finding the perfect holster can be a daunting task, but the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made it an enjoyable experience for me. As someone who carries a full-sized 1911, I was initially skeptical about how concealable it would be. However, the forward cant design ensures the gun stays tight against my body, while the raised protective backing provides both comfort and protection.

One of the things that stood out for me was the unique leather material; made from premium water buffalo leather, it's not only durable but also breaks in incredibly fast. I'm also thrilled with the right-handed draw feature which suits my dominance perfectly. The fact that it's handcrafted in the USA and backed by a lifetime warranty just adds more value to this already amazing product.

However, one minor con is that there could be more size options to cater to various types of guns. But with the available sizes fitting most compact, full-sized, and subcompact handguns, it is still a versatile choice for many.

All in all, the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made concealed carry comfortable and secure for me. It's truly a best buy for the money! "

### [Universal Pistol Holster with Concealed and Protective Features](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/slicker-pistol-universal-pistol-holster-with-chest-and-leg-mounting-options-that-will-conceal-and-pr-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Slicker Pistol Holster, and I've been using it as my go-to weapon concealment tool. This versatile holster offers both chest and leg mounting options, giving me the flexibility to wear it in different ways, depending on my outfit or activity. The material is super comfortable, and I don't even feel like I'm wearing a holster after a while.

The Slicker Pistol Holster is designed to protect your weapon, but it also conceals it incredibly well. The vanishing tan color blends seamlessly with most clothing, making it virtually invisible under a shirt or jacket. The strong materials ensure that your weapon stays securely in place, so you don't have to worry about any unwanted accidents.

One downside of this holster is that it takes some time to adjust to your specific body size. It can be a bit challenging to get the perfect fit at first, but once you've got it adjusted, it's comfortable and secure. Overall, I've been very happy with the Slicker Pistol Holster and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and inconspicuous weapon concealment solution.

### [Soft, Universal Gun Holster with Comfort and Safety](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-double-stack-compact-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-grip-tuck-universal-holster-double-stack-compact-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Alien Gear Grip Tuck Universal Holster for my compact right-hand pistol. As a concealed carrier who's always on the go, I appreciated its less rigid neoprene design that made it comfortable to wear inside the waistband. However, the textured outer material wasn't really my cup of tea. It felt a bit harsh on the skin and wasn't quite as comfortable as I'd hoped.

The holster did a great job of keeping my pistol secure and protected, especially with the rigid thermoplastic elastomer lining that safeguarded the trigger guard. I also liked the adjustable ride height and cant angle features, which allowed me to customize the position of my holster according to my preference.

On the downside, the Grip Tuck didn't fit my p365 very well as it was too big for it. It might work better with Glock 43 though. Overall, it's a decent concealed carry option, but there were some things that could be improved upon to enhance comfort and versatility.

Laws and regulations vary by state and country. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the rules and restrictions in your area regarding concealed or open carry, as well as any requirements for holsters. Consult with a local expert or your local law enforcement agency for advice on specific legislation.

### How do I properly clean and maintain my universal gun holster?

Regular cleaning and maintenance will prolong the lifespan and functionality of your holster. Nylon and leather holsters require separate care routines. For nylon holsters, use mild soap and water to clean, then let them dry naturally. For leather holsters, use a leather cleaner and conditioner to maintain flexibility and strength. Always follow the manufacturer's care instructions for the best results.

### Can a universal gun holster be worn on the right or left side?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/universal-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Universal+Gun+Holsters-6/public" alt="Universal Gun Holsters-6"></a></div>

Many universal gun holsters are designed to be ambidextrous, allowing both right- and left-handed shooters to use them. These holsters typically feature adjustable belt loops, clips, or straps, making them possible to wear on either side of the body. Check the product description or consult with the manufacturer for specific information on your chosen holster model.

### How can I adjust the fit of my universal gun holster?

Most universal holsters have adjustable retention systems, allowing you to tighten or loosen the grip on your weapon. This ensures a secure fit while still enabling a smooth draw. Additionally, many holsters offer adjustable belt loops or clips, which can help customize the cant and ride height according to your preferences and needs.

### What is the difference between a pancake-style and a paddle-style universal gun holster?

A pancake-style holster is flatter and wider than a paddle-style holster. It typically features two or more belt loops that attach directly to your waistband, evenly distributing the weight of your firearm. Pancake-style holsters are known for their concealment capabilities and comfort over extended periods. A paddle-style holster, on the other hand, relies on a paddle-shaped insert that slides between your body and waistband to anchor the holster in place. Paddle-style holsters are easier to remove and may be a better option for those who frequently switch between wearing belts and waistbands.

### What are some features to consider when choosing a universal gun holster?

- Retention system: Ensure the holster has a secure mechanism to prevent the firearm from being removed accidentally.

- Compatibility: Make sure the holster is compatible with your firearm make, model, and size.

- Adjustable features: Look for adjustable belt loops, retention, and cant to achieve a personalized fit.
