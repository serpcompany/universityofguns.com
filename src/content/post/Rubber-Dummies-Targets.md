### [EZ-Aim Handgun Trainer Target 12x12 Pack of 5](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rubber-dummies-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rubber-dummies-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="ez-aim-adhesive-splash-12x12-handgun-trainer-5-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ez-aim-adhesive-splash-12x12-handgun-trainer-5-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

Well folks, I recently decided to improve my handgun accuracy and came across the EZ Aim Adhesive Splash Handgun Trainer 5 Pack. This was a game-changer for me - every time I hit that paper, it would flake and crumble into bright yellow impact holes, letting me see exactly where my shots were landing.

The best part? These targets are adhesive-backed, which means I could stick them onto just about any surface (cardboard, plywood, steel targets) without them falling off or getting damaged. I found this particularly useful at the range as it helped me keep track of my progress.

However, one downside is that these packs only come with a limited number of targets. Once you've used them all up, you'll need to buy more. But hey, considering how fun and effective they are, I would say it's worth the investment!

So if you're looking to master your handgun skills, give the EZ Aim Adhesive Splash Handgun Trainer a try. Who knows? You might just become the next sharpshooter!

### [Quarterback Training Mannequin - GoSports Xtraman](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rubber-dummies-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rubber-dummies-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gosports-football-xtraman-dummy-defender-quarterback-training-mannequin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gosports-football-xtraman-dummy-defender-quarterback-training-mannequin-1/public"/></a></div>

You know what they say about practice making perfect, right? Well, imagine having a personal quarterback training mannequin at your disposal, ready to help you improve your accuracy, timing, and even your presence within the pocket. That's exactly what the GoSports Football Xtraman Dummy Defender Training Mannequin offers.

I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. As a former high school quarterback myself, I often struggled with hitting the right spots when throwing the ball. But with this mannequin, I can now practice in my backyard, simulating real game conditions. The large target on the mannequin helps me to concentrate on hitting it right in the numbers, honing my accuracy.

One of the best features of this product is its adaptability. You can place the dummy at different points within the so-called "pocket" to simulate rushing situations. This not only trains you to be aware of your surroundings but also helps you to develop a keen sense of timing.

By practicing with the Xtraman, I've noticed that I've become more accurate and efficient in my game. Plus, the polyester netting provides a nice soft target for the ball to hit, reducing the risk of injury.

However, there is one downside that I've noticed while using the Xtraman. The mannequin can be a bit wobbly, especially when placed on uneven ground or when the wind picks up. So, you may want to place some weight on the bottom of the stand to prevent it from tipping over.

Overall, the GoSports Football Xtraman Dummy Defender Training Mannequin is a valuable asset for anyone looking to improve their quarterbacking skills. Its adaptability and ability to simulate real game conditions make it an invaluable tool for both young and experienced quarterbacks alike.

I found that its wobbling feature post-impact made tracking accurate shots simpler, particularly since the high-visibility Radiation Green top provided excellent visibility even in low light conditions.

One concern, however, is that some users report the DuraSeal material flaking off after shots from larger calibers. Despite this, I've found the target to be considerably durable, particularly when using it for its intended purpose of. 22LR caliber firearms.
