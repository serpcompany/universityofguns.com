Indiana: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Indiana is a shall-issue state with Licenses being issued by the Indiana State Police. There is no License required to purchase a firearm, and firearms do not need to be registered. Only Indiana residents or residents of neighboring states who are at least 18 years old can buy long guns. To buy a handgun, you must be at least 21 years old and a resident of Indiana. 


### Self-Defense


Indiana is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. There is no duty to retreat if deadly force is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to the person or a third person or the commission of a forcible felony.


#### Defense of Self or Others


A person is justified in using reasonable **force** to protect the person or a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the imminent use of unlawful force.  


A person is justified in using **deadly force** if the person reasonably believes that that force is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to the person or a third person or the commission of a forcible felony.


#### Defense of Property


With respect to property other than a dwelling, curtilage, or an occupied motor vehicle, a person is justified in using reasonable **force** if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to immediately prevent or terminate the other person’s trespass on or criminal interference with property lawfully in the person’s possession, the possession of a member of the person’s immediate family, or belonging to a person whose property the person has authority to protect. 


 A person is justified in using **deadly force** only if that force is justified.


#### Immunity


No person in this state shall be placed in legal jeopardy of any kind whatsoever for protecting the person or a third person by reasonable means necessary.


[[Ind. Code § 35-41-3-2]](https://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-41-3-2.html)


#### Defense of Place


A person is justified in using reasonable **force**, including **deadly force**, and does not have a duty to retreat if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other person’s unlawful entry of or attack on the person’s dwelling, curtilage or occupied motor vehicle.
