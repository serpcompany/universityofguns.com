Tennessee: Gun Laws Summary
---------------------------


Tennessee is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the Department of Safety & Homeland Security. Non-residents may apply for a HCP if they work in the state on a regular basis and hold a valid concealed carry permit in their home state. They can only make an application after being employed for six months and then only within six months after the initial six-month work period. In terms of reciprocity, Tennessee honors all concealed carry permits from other states. ([Senate Bill 705](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/111/Bill/SB0705.pdf))


### Permitless Carry


As of July 1, 2021, a law was passed creating a statutory “exception” which allows permitless open and concealed carry for anyone that at least 18 years old or older, that may lawfully possess a handgun, is in a place where the person has a right to be and meets three additional criteria as defined in the table below. Some areas are off-limits, including government buildings and schools. ([House Bill 786](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/safety/documents/handgun/HB0786.pdf))


#### Defense of Third Person


A person is justified in threatening or using force against another to protect a third person if the person reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect the third person from unlawful force. ([Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-11-611](https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-39-criminal-offenses/tn-code-sect-39-11-611.html))


#### Defense of Property


A person in lawful possession of real or personal property or personal property of a third person is justified in threatening or using force against another when and to the degree it is reasonably believed the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other’s trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property. ([Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-11-612](https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-39-criminal-offenses/tn-code-sect-39-11-612.html))


Unless a person is justified in using deadly force as otherwise provided by law, a person is not justified in using deadly force to prevent or terminate the other’s trespass on real estate or unlawful interference with personal property. ([Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-11-614](https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-39-criminal-offenses/tn-code-sect-39-11-614.html))


#### Self-Defense


Tennessee is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is in a place lawfully and who is not engaged in illegal activity has no duty to retreat before using or threatening to use force that’s likely to cause serious bodily injury or death if:


* The person reasonably believes there’s an imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death;
* The danger is real or honestly believed to be real at the time; and
* The belief of danger is founded upon reasonable grounds.


A person who uses deadly force within a residence, business, dwelling or vehicle is presumed to have held a reasonable belief of imminent death or serious bodily injury to self, family, a member of the household or a person visiting as an invited guest when the force is used against someone who unlawfully and forcibly entered the place. ([Tenn. Code. Ann. § 39-11-611](https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-39-criminal-offenses/tn-code-sect-39-11-611.html))

(In April 2021, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) sued the state of Tennessee for prohibiting 18- to 20-year-olds from carrying a concealed firearm in public or from obtaining a permit, stating that these restrictions were unconstitutional. On Jan. 23, 2023, Attorneys for the state of Tennessee entered into an agreed order in federal court with the FPC. The order stipulates that the state’s restrictions were unconstitutional and that they will no longer be enforced. The order immediately went into effect).
