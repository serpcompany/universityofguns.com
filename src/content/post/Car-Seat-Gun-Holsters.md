### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

### [Headrest Gun Rack for Car Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="snapsafe-gun-rack-vehicle-headrest-2-75882" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapsafe-gun-rack-vehicle-headrest-2-75882/public"/></a></div>

As an everyday user of the Snapsafe Gun Rack, I can attest to its brilliance. Upon installation, I was blown away by how easily it fit onto my vehicle's headrest, making it quick and convenient to secure my long gun. The coated wire ensured that my firearm stayed protected from scratches while in transit. Additionally, the hooks doubled as storage for my range bag and groceries, adding a level of practicality that I absolutely love.

There were a few cons that came to my notice though. The hooks tended to sway a bit when driving, especially on bumpy roads. This motion could potentially cause some damage to the firearm in the long run. Another issue was the size of the hooks, which could not accommodate larger firearms.

Overall, the Snapsafe Gun Rack is a solid investment for those who frequently carry long guns while driving. Its versatile design, easy installation, and protective coating easily outweigh the cons, making it a must-have for safety-conscious drivers.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="dasiyoki-tactical-car-seat-back-organizer-with-molle-panel-vehicle-gun-holder-seat-back-storage-cove-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dasiyoki-tactical-car-seat-back-organizer-with-molle-panel-vehicle-gun-holder-seat-back-storage-cove-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently came across this fantastic Tactical Car Seat Back Organizer, and thought it truly deserves a mention. This automotive gun rack has made traveling so much more comfortable and convenient for me. Made of high-quality 1000D nylon, it's incredibly durable and perfect for my Tacoma, F150, and pickup seat back.

One of the perks is its capacity. It can hold up to 60 lbs, making it a reliable gun safe organizer for my vehicle. Its dimensions of 14.5"W by 22.5"H make it a universal fit for various vehicles, including trucks, F150s, and pickups.

The most exciting feature for me is the Molle straps and pockets, which offer multifunctional storage. I can hang additional tactical pouches and even place my hunting files. Plus, there are two pockets for storing smaller items like toys or umbrellas, making travel even more fun.

However, I would like to mention that the packaging could be a bit better. When I received it, the corners were slightly dented. Despite this, the quality of the product itself more than compensated for the packaging defect.

In conclusion, this Tactical Car Seat Back Organizer has been a game-changer for me. Its durable material, adjustable design, and multifunctional compartments make it a must-have if you're often on the road.

### [Galco ambidextrous VHS 4.0 Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-tan-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-vhs-4-0-shoulder-holster-1911-4-5-ambi-tan-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had the pleasure of using several shoulder holsters. However, the Galco VHS 4.0 for my 1911 4-5" really takes the cake. This ambidextrous beauty is a game-changer, especially when I need quick access to my firearm. The vertical double magazine carrier with its secure flaps is just the icing on the cake.

One of the standout features of the Galco VHS 4.0 is its comfortable wide harness. It's designed with a swiveling Flexalon backplate, providing a level of comfort that lasts all day. Plus, it's incredibly versatile, offering compatibility with various firearm sizes and body types. The adjustable harness ensures a perfect fit for both left and right-handed users.

However, no product is perfect. One minor issue I experienced was the occasional need for adjustments to maintain a secure fit. Additionally, the magazine carrier could benefit from a tie-down feature for added stability.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galco VHS 4.0 is an exceptional shoulder holster. Its ergonomic design and versatility make it an ideal choice for shooters who prioritize comfort and convenience. Whether you're a lefty or a righty, this holster is sure to provide a secure and comfortable home for your 1911.

### [Back Seat Gun Holder Rifle Rack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="back-seat-gun-holder-shotgun-truck-rack-vehicle-rack-car-hunting-rifle-oak-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/back-seat-gun-holder-shotgun-truck-rack-vehicle-rack-car-hunting-rifle-oak-1/public"/></a></div>

My old car seat gun holster was always flimsy and unsafe, but ever since I got my hands on this Back Seat Gun Holder, it's been a game changer. The straps are sturdy, made of 600D Polyester Nylon and ABS Polymer clasps, ensuring my guns are securely held in place during travel. Not only does this gun holder allow me to keep my hands free while driving, but it also adds an element of organization, with a Shotgun shell holder on each side.

However, the product does have its downsides. The 21-inch width might not be compatible with all vehicles, and it's designed primarily for rifles and longer shotguns. If you're looking to transport shorter-barreled shotguns, you might need to consider other alternatives. Additionally, the shell holder could benefit from a more secure design, perhaps with a Velcro flap closure instead of the elastic loops provided.

Despite these cons, the Back Seat Gun Holder is a high-quality, reliable solution for transporting rifles and shotguns safely and securely. It's a testament to the importance of investing in quality products that make our lives easier and safer.

### [Seat Gun Holder for UTVs](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/car-seat-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="on-seat-utv-gun-holder-superatv-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/on-seat-utv-gun-holder-superatv-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the On-Seat UTV Gun Holder and let me tell you, it has completely changed my hunting trips for the better. The heavy-duty foam construction holds two long guns securely, making them easily accessible and protected from damage.

A standout feature of this product is how seamlessly it integrates with my seat belt. It's so convenient that I can safely store my rifles without needing any additional tools or straps. It's definitely worth the investment if you're serious about protecting your firearms while riding in your utility vehicle.

However, there's one drawback that I noticed - the ratchet strap provided isn't always effective. In some cases, I had to purchase an extra strap to ensure a secure fit. Despite this minor inconvenience, I still give the On-Seat UTV Gun Holder a high rating for its durability and practicality.

For those looking for a reliable solution to safely store their hunting gear on their utility vehicle, this product is definitely worth checking out.
