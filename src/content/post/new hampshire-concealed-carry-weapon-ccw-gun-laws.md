New Hampshire: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------------


New Hampshire is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Residents apply to the local law enforcement office and non-residents to the State Department of Justice. There is no permit, background check or firearms registration required to buy a handgun from a private individual. Open carry and concealed carry are legal in New Hampshire without a license for anyone at least 18 years of age who can legally possess a firearm. [1]


### Self-Defense


New Hampshire is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is lawfully in a place or location and who is threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat from a threat prior to using force. [1]


#### Use of Force in Defense of Premises


A person in possession or control of premises or a person who is licensed or privileged to be there is justified in using non-deadly force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission of a criminal trespass by such other in or upon such premises. But he or she may use deadly force under such circumstances only in defense of a person or when one reasonably believes it necessary to prevent an attempt by the trespasser to commit arson. [1]


#### Civil Immunity


A person who justifiably uses force in self-protection or in the protection of other persons, in the protection of premises and property, in law enforcement or in the care or welfare of a minor pursuant, shall be immune from civil liability for personal injuries sustained by a perpetrator. [1]


#### Physical Force in Defense of a Person


A person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another person in order to defend himself or herself or a third person from what one reasonably believes to be the imminent use of unlawful, non-deadly force, and a person may use a degree of such force which he or she reasonably believes to be necessary. A person is justified in using deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that another person is: About to use unlawful, deadly force against the actor or a third person; Is likely to use any unlawful force against a person present while committing or attempting to commit a burglary; Is committing or about to commit kidnapping or a forcible sex offense; or Is likely to use any unlawful force in the commission of a felony against the actor within such actor’s dwelling or its curtilage. [1]


##### Deadly force is not justified if the actor knows that he or she and the third person can, with complete safety:


* Retreat from the encounter (except that he or she is not required to retreat if he or she is within his or her dwelling, its curtilage or anywhere he or she has a right to be) and was not the initial aggressor; or
* Surrender property to the person; or
* Comply with a demand that he or she abstain from performing an act which the actor is not obliged to perform.


“Curtilage” means those outbuildings which are proximately, directly and intimately connected with a dwelling, together with all the land or grounds surrounding the dwelling such as are necessary, convenient and habitually used for domestic purposes.“Dwelling” means any building, structure, vehicle, boat or other place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons or sections of any place similarly adapted. It is immaterial whether a person is actually present. [1]
