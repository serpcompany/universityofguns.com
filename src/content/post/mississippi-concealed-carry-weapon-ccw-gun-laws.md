Mississippi: Gun Laws Summary
-----------------------------


Mississippi is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety. There is no permit, background check or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. A background check is required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer. [[source](https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/mississippi/)]


### Self-Defense


Mississippi is a castle doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is not the initial aggressor and is not engaged in unlawful activity shall have no duty to retreat before using deadly force if the person is in a place where the person has a right to be. [[source](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/castle-doctrine-in-mississippi/)]


#### Justifiable Homicide


Homicide may be justified in the following cases.


* When committed by a person in resisting being killed, resisting a felony upon the person, or upon or in any dwelling, vehicle, place of business, place of employment or in the immediate premises thereof in which such person shall be.
* When committed in the lawful defense of one’s own person or any other human being, where it is reasonable to believe the person was in imminent danger of a felony or great personal injury.


“Dwelling” means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over it, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, including a tent, that is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night, including any attached porch. The statute provides that a person acting in justifiable self-defense shall have similar presumptions in civil cases and is immune from civil suits if found “not guilty” in criminal proceedings.
