Louisiana: Gun Laws Summary
---------------------------


As a shall-issue state, Louisiana permits concealed weapons with the Louisiana Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP), which is available to residents and military members permanently stationed within the state. Non-resident permits are not available, but exemptions apply to non-residents in the military who possess a Louisiana driver’s license or Louisiana state ID. Individuals must be at least 21 years old and complete a firearms training course to apply for a permit. Louisiana also recognizes permits issued by states that recognize Louisiana permits.


Private sales of handguns do not require permits, background checks, or firearms registration in Louisiana. The state also allows open carry of firearms in public without a permit for individuals at least 18 years old who are not prohibited from possessing firearms. Certain areas, such as parades and bars, are off-limits for open carry.


**Use of Force in Defense:**


### Stand Your Ground


Louisiana is a Castle Doctrine state with a “stand your ground” statute. There is no duty to retreat in any place a person has the legal right to be before using force or violence, and a person may meet force with force.


#### Justifiable Use of Force


The use of force is justifiable in Louisiana when committed to prevent a forcible offense against a person or trespass against property in a person’s lawful possession, provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense. It is also justifiable to use force or violence against an unlawful entry into a dwelling, place of business, or motor vehicle when the person using the force or violence reasonably believes that it is necessary to prevent the entry or to compel the intruder to leave.


#### Defense of Others


It is justifiable to use deadly force in Louisiana when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used such means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary to protect the other person. [La. Rev. Stat. [14:19](http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?p=y&d=78336), [14:20](http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78338) & [14:22](http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78358)]
