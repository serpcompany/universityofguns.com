### [Crescent Shield Series 12-Gun Fire Resistant Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-cs-12c-crescent-shield-series-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-cs-12c-crescent-shield-series-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe for a few months now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. As someone who values both security and style, this gun safe has delivered on both fronts. The 12-gauge steel and 1.5-inch chrome, steel bolts make me feel confident that my belongings are secure, while the deluxe interior with its deep grey foam-backed liner adds a touch of class.

The fire resistance feature is truly impressive – it can withstand fires for up to 75 minutes, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my firearms and documents are well-protected. The drill-resistant hard plate is another great security feature that adds an extra layer of protection. Additionally, the UL-listed, Type 1 rated S&G dial lock ensures that only I have access to the safe.

However, there is a minor issue with the lock mechanism, which can sometimes be a bit stubborn. Despite this, the pros easily outweigh the cons, making the Hollon CS-12C Crescent Shield Series Gun Safe a worthwhile investment for anyone in need of secure gun storage.

### [White Republic Gun Safe - Sturdy and Spacious Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-white-rg-42-republic-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-white-rg-42-republic-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a gun enthusiast, I recently got the chance to try out the Hollon White RG-42 Republic Gun Safe and I'm happy to say that it's a real game-changer. This safe is not only visually appealing with its classic look, but also incredibly secure and spacious.

One of the standout features of this safe is how well-built it is. It's reinforced with 300% thicker steel than other leading brands, which gives me peace of mind knowing that my firearms are well protected. The adjustable racking and pocket door organizer make it easy for me to store and access my collection, and the LED motion light kit is a nice touch.

However, one downside is the lack of mounting hardware included in the package. While this is a minor inconvenience, it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the safe.

All in all, I highly recommend the Hollon White RG-42 Republic Gun Safe. It provides excellent protection for your firearms and valuables and it looks great in my den.

### [Black Hawk 90-Minute Fire-Rated Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-90-min-bhs-16-black-hawk-gun-safe-series-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-90-min-bhs-16-black-hawk-gun-safe-series-1/public"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I found myself in the market for a high-quality gun safe. After plenty of research and contemplation, I landed on the Hollon Black Hawk Gun Safe Series. I've been using it for about six months now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

The first thing that struck me about this safe is its sturdiness. It's crafted from 10 gauge steel, with an additional ¼ inch steel plate on the door, making it 30% thicker than most competing brands. This creates a barrier that can withstand any type of attack, whether it's from a crowbar or pry bar.

Another feature I absolutely adore is its interior LED lighting. It comes with a pre-installed power strip, which means I don't have to worry about installing extra lighting or dealing with messy wires. Plus, the electronic lock is incredibly easy to program and provides an added layer of security.

However, there are two minor drawbacks I've noticed. Firstly, the safe can be a little challenging to set up, especially if you're not particularly skilled with measurements. Secondly, although the extra shelves are a nice touch, they could be more versatile. They only span half way across the safe, which means they're not as useful for larger items.

All things considered, the Hollon Black Hawk Gun Safe Series is a fantastic investment. Its robust construction, ample storage space, and top-notch security features make it a must-have for anyone with a valuable collection of firearms or other items that need protection.

### [Hunter Series 9.04 cubic feet 45-minute fire-rated, 12-gauge steel gun safe with 16-gun capacity and electronic lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-hgs-11e-hunter-series-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-hgs-11e-hunter-series-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Hollon Hunter Series Gun Safe, and I have to say, it's a game-changer. I've been on the hunt for a safe and secure way to store my firearms, and this one has surpassed all my expectations.

The first thing that struck me about this safe was its sturdiness. Being made from 12-gauge steel, it's incredibly tough and resilient. I also loved how many locking bolts there are - up to twelve on all four sides. This ensures maximum protection against any pry attacks.

In terms of size, it's perfect for my needs. The interior dimensions (53 x 22 1/4 x 13 1/4) comfortably accommodate all my long guns and some smaller ones too. Plus, I can fit everything else in there without feeling cramped.

However, one minor drawback is that the exterior width is quite limited at just 18 inches. If you're looking to store wider items or more than one scoped AR15, this might not be the best option for you.

All in all, I'm extremely satisfied with the Hollon HGS-11E Gun Safe. Its combination of strength, security, and stylish appearance makes it a worthy addition to any home. If you're in the market for a new gun safe, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

### [Hollon PM-1014E Gun Safe with Fire and Burglary Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-pm-1014e-tl-15-rated-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-pm-1014e-tl-15-rated-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

When it came to finding a safe for my apartment, I knew I needed something that was both secure and compact. That's why I decided to give the Hollon PM-1014E a try. Let me tell you, this little gem is like Fort Knox in a box.

First off, the locking mechanism is super user-friendly, making it easy for me to access my valuable belongings when needed. But don't let its simplicity fool you – this safe is built to withstand some serious firepower. In fact, it even survived a 2-hour factory fire test where the internal temperature never exceeded 350 degrees F. That's pretty impressive!

The outside is equally rugged, featuring a special designed burglary resistant handle, glass re-locker, hard plate behind the lock, and a highly compressed proprietary concrete material. Any potential thieves would have a tough time cracking this safe open, and even if they did, they'd quickly realize there's no room for error. Each door has multiple steel layers and U-channels with different gauges ranging from 3, 8, and 10. And let's not forget about the 1/4" thick armor plating on the entire front door, guaranteeing maximum protection.

The interior of the safe is just as impressive, boasting ample space for all my prized possessions. From important documents to family heirlooms, I can rest assured knowing that everything is safe and secure inside.

But it's not just about security – the Hollon PM-1014E is also incredibly well-made. There's an attention to detail that's evident in every aspect of the design, from the sturdy door to the smooth-sliding bolt work.

Overall, my experience with the Hollon PM-1014E has been nothing short of exceptional. In the words of many satisfied customers, "This is the real deal" and "definitely a good choice for valuables. " So if you're in the market for a compact yet highly secure safe, I highly recommend giving this one a shot.

### [Black Hawk 90-Min Durable Gun Safe with 16 Rifle Capacity](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-90-min-bhs-22-black-hawk-gun-safe-series-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-90-min-bhs-22-black-hawk-gun-safe-series-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently bought the Hollon Black Hawk Gun Safe to protect my beloved firearms and other valuable possessions. After spending weeks researching different options on the market, I finally decided on this one.

The first thing that caught my eye about this safe is its robust design. Built with high-quality 10-gauge steel and an additional ¼-inch steel plate on the interior of the door, it provides excellent protection against various types of threats. Its thick door ensures that it can withstand even the most relentless attacks using crowbars or pry bars.

One of the standout features for me is its interior capacity. Despite being relatively compact, this safe can easily accommodate up to 16 long guns, providing ample space for storing all of my firearms securely. In addition to the main storage area, it also comes with adjustable shelving, so I can customize the layout to suit my needs perfectly.

Another aspect I appreciate is how easy it is to set up. The electronic lock comes with a simple and intuitive programming process, making it accessible even for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. Plus, the pre-installed power strip and LED lighting save time and money compared to purchasing them separately.

However, there is one minor drawback to this safe - the lack of a clear and concise instruction manual. While I was able to figure out most things on my own, some parts of the setup process would have been smoother with better guidance.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Hollon Black Hawk Gun Safe. Its solid construction, spacious interior, and ease of use make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to secure their valuable possessions.

### [Durable B-Rated Cash Safe by Hollon](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-b2015c-b-rated-cash-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-b2015c-b-rated-cash-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Hollon B2015C B Rated Cash Safe, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance. This solid steel safe is perfect for keeping your cash secure, especially in high-traffic environments. As someone who works tips, I appreciate the added protection it provides.

One of the key features that caught my eye is its drill-resistant hard plate, making it much more difficult for burglars to access the safe's contents. Additionally, the active spring loaded re-locker ensures the safe stays locked even if someone manages to tamper with the main locking mechanism. These added security measures are a testament to Hollon's commitment to providing top-notch safety options for their customers.

However, there are a few areas where the safe could be improved. For instance, the electronic dial can be challenging to program at first, though I eventually figured it out with some assistance from customer service. Another minor inconvenience is the absence of a removable or adjustable shelf, which would have made organizing the contents a bit easier.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have no hesitation in recommending the Hollon B2015C B Rated Cash Safe. Its durability, robust security features, and overall ease of use make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable cash storage solution.

### [Hunter Series 12 Gauge Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hollon-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hollon-hgs-16e-hunter-series-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hollon-hgs-16e-hunter-series-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a passionate hunter, I've always been on the lookout for the perfect gun safe. When I heard about Hollon's Hunter Series gun safe, I was skeptical, given the high-quality safes I've used in the past. However, I couldn't resist giving it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did!

The first thing that stood out to me was the thickness of the steel on this safe - 12 gauge! It's stronger than most big-box retail gun safes I've seen, making me feel confident about the safety of my firearms. Additionally, the up to twelve 1.25 inch locking bolts on all four sides make it incredibly resistant to pry attacks.

One of the highlights of this gun safe is its capacity. It can hold up to 16 long guns and has spacious door pockets for smaller handguns. This has allowed me to store my entire collection — from scoped AR15 SBRs and 12GA pump shotguns to a 308 hunting rifle - without any issues.

The Hunter Series gun safe not only provides excellent protection, but it also boasts a sleek, black material that adds a touch of visual appeal to my room. Its sturdiness and ease of setup are also noteworthy.

However, there's room for improvement. While the size is just right for smaller firearm collections, it may not be suitable for those with extensive collections. Additionally, I wish the product description included information about extra shelf clips, as my order did not come with them.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with Hollon's Hunter Series gun safe. It offers the perfect combination of security, space, and style. If you're in the market for a reliable and high-quality gun safe, I highly recommend giving this one a shot.

This B Rated Cash Safe by Hollon has been a lifesaver when it comes to securing my valuables. I was initially drawn to its solid steel construction and Gray Material design, which give it a modern look while also ensuring strong protection.

The highlight for me was the impressive 1/2" Solid Steel Door on this safe - it's not just heavy-duty, but also incredibly secure. The door features four 1 1/4" massive chrome plated solid steel live locking bolts that make breaking in extremely difficult, even for burglars.

One downside I found was the lack of water resistance. But considering its primary purpose is to keep my cash safe from thieves, this isn't a deal-breaker for me.

Another feature I appreciated was the SnG electronic lock, which is both reliable and easy to program. It's protected by an internal spring loaded re-locking device, adding an extra layer of security.

I also appreciated the 4 pre drilled mounting holes that allowed me to bolt the safe down securely. This may seem like a small detail, but it provides peace of mind knowing my valuables are protected in more ways than one.

However, I do wish the installation process was easier. The shelf didn't fit perfectly, which made setting up the safe a bit more challenging than I expected.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The Hollon B-2015E B Rated Cash Safe has provided excellent protection for my valuables and is definitely worth the investment.
