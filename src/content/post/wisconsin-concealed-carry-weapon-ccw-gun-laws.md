Wisconsin: Gun Laws Summary
---------------------------


Wisconsin gun laws operate at the state level with concealed carry weapons (CCW) licenses issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ). It is a shall-issue state, meaning that if all criteria are met, the DOJ must issue a CCW license. CCW licenses are only issued to residents and military personnel stationed in Wisconsin. Applicants must be 21 or older, have completed a firearms training course, and meet other criteria. Non-residents with a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors can also carry concealed in Wisconsin. 


Open carry is legal for any person that is 18 years or older and not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state and federal laws. 


### Defense of Property and Protection Against Retail Theft


A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force for the purpose of preventing or terminating what the person reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference with the person’s property. Only such degree of force or threat thereof may intentionally be used as the actor reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. It is not reasonable to intentionally use deadly force for the sole purpose of defense of one’s property. 


A person is privileged to defend a third person’s property from real or apparent unlawful interference under the same conditions and by the same means as those under and by which the person is privileged to defend his or her own property, provided that the person reasonably believes that the facts are such as would give the third person the privilege to defend his or her own property and that the third person whose property the person is protecting is a member of his or her immediate family or household or a person whose property the person has a legal duty to protect, or is a merchant and the actor is the merchant’s employee or agent. An official or adult employee or agent of a library is privileged to defend the property of the library in the manner specified in this subsection. [[Wis. Stat. § 939.48](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/III/48), [Wis. Stat. § 939.49](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/III/49)]


#### Self-Defense


Wisconsin is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no duty to retreat, and the law applies at a person’s residence, vehicle, or business. 


#### Self-Defense and Defense of Others


A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force against another only if the actor reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. The actor may not intentionally use deadly force unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself. A person is privileged to defend a third person from real or apparent unlawful interference under the same conditions and by the same means as those under and by which the person is privileged to defend himself or herself from real or apparent unlawful interference, provided that the person reasonably believes that the facts are such that the third person would be privileged to act in self-defense and that the person’s intervention is necessary for the protection of the third person. If an actor intentionally used deadly force, the court may not consider whether the actor had an opportunity to flee or retreat before he or she used force and shall presume that the actor reasonably believed that the force was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself if either of the following applies: the person against whom the force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcibly entering the actor’s dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; the actor was present in the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; and the actor knew or reasonably believed that an unlawful and forcible entry was occurring; or the person against whom the force was used was in the actor’s dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business after unlawfully and forcibly entering it; the actor was present in the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; and the actor knew or reasonably believed that the person had unlawfully and forcibly entered the dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business. “Dwelling” means any premises or portion of a premises that is used as a home or a place of residence and that part of the lot or site on which the dwelling is situated that is devoted to residential use. “Dwelling” includes other existing structures on the immediate residential premises such as driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, fences, porches, garages, and basements. “Place of business” means a business that the actor owns or operates. [[Wis. Stat. § 939.48](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/III/48), [Wis. Stat. § 939.49](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/III/49)]

| Brandishing | Wisconsin law does not define brandishing, but anyone who endangers another's safety by the negligent operation or handling of a dangerous weapon, or intentionally points a firearm at or toward another shall be charged. Violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud or otherwise disorderly conduct in public or private places under circumstances that tend to cause or provoke a disturbance is also prohibited. |
| Carrying a firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances | Carrying a concealed firearm while consuming or under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is illegal. This also applies if a person has a detectable amount of a restricted controlled substance in their blood. Under the influence of an intoxicant means that the actor's ability to operate a vehicle or handle a firearm or airgun is materially impaired because of their consumption of an alcohol beverage, hazardous inhalant, a controlled substance, controlled substance analog, or any combination of those things.

These restrictions do not apply to firearms that are in vehicles driven or parked in parking facilities on these properties.  |
| Red flag law | Wisconsin does not have a red flag law. |
| Duty to inform law enforcement | In Wisconsin, there is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm unless the officer asks. |
