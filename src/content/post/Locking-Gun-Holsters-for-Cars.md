### [Portable Instant-Access Handgun Safe with Gesture Code Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="stopbox-instant-access-handgun-lock-box-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stopbox-instant-access-handgun-lock-box-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the StopBox for a while, I've found it to be a great blend of security and accessibility. The construction is solid and not having to worry about batteries dying in the middle of the night adds peace of mind. Customizing my combination code was easy and worked well for me and my spouse.

The size is perfect for our nightstand or drawer, not taking up much space at all. To our surprise, it easily fit our S&W M&P 9mm with a spare mag inside - perfect for emergencies. The downside is that we would have preferred metal internals instead of plastic, along with more interior space to accommodate a full-sized pistol with ease. However, considering how fast this box provides access when needed is important too! With several color options available that match our existing decor, this little safe fits right in seamlessly into any room's design.

Overall, if you're looking for something between safe storage and quick access when your firearm is most needed without breaking the bank - look no further than StopBox!

### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

### [Sturdy Bulldog Car Vault for Gun & Valuables Security](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="bulldog-car-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-car-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The Bulldog Car Vault is my go-to solution for securing my handgun while on the go. Its compact size allows it to seamlessly fit in various vehicles, such as cars, trucks, boats, and even the office. The mounting bracket provides a secure way to keep your valuable items safe from prying eyes. Even when not locked, the vault can be secured using the versatile 3-foot security cable.

Speaking from experience, I appreciate the heavy-duty steel construction of the vault, which offers ample protection for whatever I store inside. The soft, scratch-resistant lining adds an extra layer of protection to help prevent any damage to your belongings. The dimensions of this vault are 8.7" x 6" x 2.5", allowing it to fit different handguns and some accompanying accessories comfortably. The overall look of the Car Vault is sleek, with a black matte powder paint finish that adds a touch of elegance.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I have to say, the screws that come with it don't seem to work well on sheet metal surfaces. Instead of the more appropriate universal metal type screws, the mounting kit would benefit from more aggressive ones. Additionally, while the security cable is a lovely feature for added security, it could be sturdier.

Overall, the Bulldog Car Vault offers a convenient and cost-effective means for safely storing handguns in various settings. It is especially useful for those who frequently travel across state lines, where different firearm laws apply. Its durability and unique design make it a worthy contender in the realm of portable safes.

### [Seizmik ICOS: Silent, Secure, In-Cab Seat Gun Holder](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seizmik-icos-in-cab-on-seat-gun-holder-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder, and I must say, it's been quite an adventure. I've been using it for my traditional-style muzzleloader, and the first thing that struck me was how securely it held my rifle, even during some of the bumpiest rides.

One of the features I appreciated most was the closed-cell foam cushioning. It not only prevented any damage to my muzzleloader but also ensured that I didn't have to deal with any annoying rattles or noises while driving.

Another highlight of this product is its ease of installation. It took me just a few seconds to buckle it into place using the vehicle seat belt, and it was ready to go. Plus, the muzzle control feature was a game-changer, making sure that my gun barrels were always pointed safely downward.

However, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder isn't perfect. Some users have reported issues with the straps and buckles, which might not hold up as well as one would hope. Additionally, if your seatbelt design is different from what the holder was designed for, you might need to make some adjustments or modifications.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a reliable and secure way to carry your firearms in your vehicle, the Seizmik ICOS Gun Holder is definitely worth considering. As long as you're aware of any potential downsides, I think you'll find it to be an excellent investment.

I recently purchased the Hornady Lock Box XL to store my handguns and other valuables, and I must say, I'm quite impressed. The first thing that caught my eye was the 1,500 lb. rated steel cable, which secures the lockbox to any stationary object, like a vehicle seat or piece of furniture.

One feature that stands out is the patented, space-saving receiver of the cable, which allows maximum storage space inside the box. I can easily fit a 1911 size pistol or a 4-inch revolver without any issues. Plus, the lockbox provides additional security for concealed carry permit holders.

The sturdiness of the lockbox is notable, with its reliable steel barrel lock that opens smoothly using the two included keys. The 4-foot steel security cable, capable of withstanding up to 1,500 pounds of force, gives me peace of mind knowing that my belongings are protected.

I also appreciate the durable 16-gauge steel housing, which contributes to the box's resistance against pry attempts.

### [Tufloc Mini Tufbox Under-Seat Lockbox](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="tufloc-mini-tufbox-under-seat-lockbox-76-120" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tufloc-mini-tufbox-under-seat-lockbox-76-120/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Tufloc Mini Tufbox Under-seat Lockbox, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer when it comes to keeping my valuables secure. This lockbox conveniently stores my handgun and is perfect for keeping under the seat or in the trunk of my vehicle. I've even installed it at home, mounting it under my desk for easy access.

The sturdy construction is definitely a highlight, giving me peace of mind that my belongings are well-protected. However, the installation process did require a bit of DIY effort - I had to fabricate a bracket and weld it to the lockbox for a seamless fit in my car.

All in all, the Tufloc Mini Tufbox has provided me with the added security and convenience that I was looking for. I would recommend it to anyone shopping for a lockbox solution.

### [Durable Locking Gun Rack for up to 3 Firearms](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="allen-three-gun-locking-gun-rack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allen-three-gun-locking-gun-rack-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Allen Three Gun Locking Gun Rack, and it's been a game-changer for storing my arsenal. This sturdy rack can hold up to three firearms, whether they're long guns or handguns. One feature that really stood out to me was how adjustable it is - it can go from 18'' to 26'' in length, making it perfect for any size vehicle or space.

What I love about this gun rack is how solid it feels. Its high-quality steel construction gives me peace of mind knowing that my guns are securely held in place, even when I'm cruising over bumpy roads or trails. The plastisol coating also ensures that my guns will stay free from scratches and damage, which is a huge plus.

However, there are some downsides worth mentioning. The plastic-coated steel cable for securing guns tends to be a bit flimsy, and I've had to replace it with a sturdier one to ensure my weapons stay put. Additionally, the locking mechanism could use some improvement - it's not as robust as I'd like, and I worry about someone being able to easily pry it open.

Overall, the Allen Three Gun Locking Gun Rack has been a reliable and useful addition to my collection. While there are a few minor issues that could be improved upon, I would recommend this product to any hunter or gun enthusiast looking for a secure and adjustable way to store their firearms.

### [Dodge Ram Console Armrest Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/locking-gun-holsters-for-cars?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="locker-down-ld2059-armrest-safe-2012-2021-dodge-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/locker-down-ld2059-armrest-safe-2012-2021-dodge-1/public"/></a></div>

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of lock options available with this safe, ranging from manual combination locks to electronic ones.

One of the standout features of the LD2059 model is its two lid options – standard and extreme. The extreme option provides additional security by eliminating pry points, making it harder for thieves to access your belongings.

However, there was one minor issue I encountered during installation. The screw provided to secure the safe in the console on the passenger side front seat was too short, making it difficult to attach properly.

Overall, the Lock'er Down LD2059 Armrest Safe offers great security for your valuable items while in your vehicle. Just be prepared for potential minor installation issues with some models.
