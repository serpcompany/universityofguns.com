### [Browning BX18 Secure Firearm Storage](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="browning-bx18-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-bx18-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently had the chance to use the Browning BX18 Gun Safe in my home, and I must say, it's been an impressive addition to our security arrangements. The large capacity holds up to 18 long guns, providing ample space for all of our firearms. The electronic keypad lock offers quick and easy access, while the 3-spoke handle slides back effortlessly to engage the 4 locking bolts.

What really stood out to me was the modular shelving system. Being able to customize the space inside the safe has made organizing my collection incredibly easy. The fabric interior walls provide extra protection against any scratches or abrasions, ensuring that our firearms remain in pristine condition.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The door appears to be slightly loose-fitting, so it rattles a little when locked, which could be a concern for some buyers. Additionally, the overall build quality seems to be lacking compared to similarly-priced safes. Despite these minor issues, the Browning BX18 Gun Safe has proven to be a reliable and efficient solution for my firearm storage and protection needs.

I've been using the Browning BX30 Gun Safe in my home, and I must say it's been a game-changer for organizing and protecting my firearms collection. This safe has a 14-gauge steel body with a sleek grey hammer-textured finish, making it both attractively modern and incredibly sturdy.

The one feature that truly stands out is the door's 35 inches width which accommodated all my long guns comfortably - quite impressive given their size! Not only that, but the 9 handguns on the door pockets are also a nice touch. The electronic lock provides easy access and personalized security, while the 45-minute fire rating at 1,200°F ensures your guns remain safe, even during emergencies.

What I didn't like about this safe was the door's initial loose fit. However, after some adjustments to the tension screw, it now feels much snugger and secure. Additionally, the lack of an interior light could be improved, making it slightly challenging to navigate in dimly lit spaces.

Overall, the Browning BX30 Gun Safe is an excellent choice for individuals looking for a spacious, well-crafted gun safe that offers ample storage and protection. Despite its minor flaws, its sturdiness and advanced features make it a fantastic addition to any home.

The automated interior lighting also makes finding what I need quick and easy, even in low light conditions.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this safe. The spacing of the storage locations can be a bit challenging, particularly for smaller firearms.

The depth of the safe may also be a concern for modern firearms with a pistol grip, as it could lead to problems when organizing your collection.

In conclusion, the Browning Hell's Canyon Gun Safe has been a trusty companion in keeping my firearms and rifles secure.

I've been using the Browning Silver Series Gun Safe-49 Wide for a few months now and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, two-tone design which suits perfectly in my home without looking out of place.

The real star of this safe though is the spacious interior. It comfortably fits up to 49 long guns - more than enough for even the most avid collector. Plus, the additional vertical space and extra Axis shelving option make it easy to store other items securely as well.

One downside I noticed was the slightly awkward shape due to its 25" exterior depth. While it doesn't exactly take over the room, it does leave less space than what you'd expect from a tall, wide safe.

Another concern for me was the locking mechanism. Although it comes with a Force Deflector system, I faced an issue where the combination provided with the safe didn't work as expected. This was frustrating at first, but Browning's customer service was excellent and they promptly resolved the situation.

I recently had the chance to get up close and personal with the Browning 1878-49T gun safe, and boy, was I impressed! This tall and wide safe truly lives up to its reputation. As an avid shooter, I'm always on the lookout for secure storage solutions for my firearms, and this one did not disappoint.

From my personal experience, the key feature that really stood out was its 45 cubic feet capacity. I was able to store more than just my guns in there – plenty of space left over for ammunition, scopes, and other accessories. The adjustable shelving also proved quite useful, allowing me to customize the interior layout according to my needs.

Another aspect I found particularly noteworthy was its 90-minute fire-resistant rating. For peace of mind, knowing that my valuables are protected from heat-related damage in case of a fire is invaluable.

However, there's no denying that this behemoth isn't without its drawbacks. Its size is both a blessing and a curse - while it provides ample storage, it might be challenging to fit in some smaller rooms. Additionally, the weight of nearly 1000 pounds could make mounting it on carpeting rather tricky.

Nevertheless, considering everything it has to offer - from its robust security features to its spacious interior - the Browning 1878-49T gun safe is definitely worth a look for anyone in need of reliable protection for their firearms.

### [Browning Sporter Gun Safe: Secure Storage for 23 Long Guns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/browning-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-sp23-sporter-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a gun owner, I've been using Browning's SP23 Sporter Gun Safe in my home for the past year. It's been a game-changer, providing certified security while also fitting perfectly in tight spaces. The SP23's smaller size makes it perfect for keeping home defense rifles or shotguns accessible, but secure, in my bedroom.

One of the things that really stood out to me is its craftsmanship. The 12-gauge steel body and 1-inch formed door offer unmatched protection and durability. The 8 bolt system, with 5 active bolts, gives me peace of mind knowing my guns are well-protected. Plus, the adjustable shelving allows me to customize the interior to fit my specific needs.

However, there are a few cons to consider. Firstly, while the SP23 is technically capable of holding up to 23 long guns, I've found that in reality, it's more like 12-14 rifles with optics. This is due to the tight packing, which may not be optimal for everyone. Additionally, the price point can be a bit steep for some, as it is on the pricier side for a smaller safe.

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Browning SP23 Sporter Gun Safe to anyone looking for a high-quality, compact solution for securing their firearms at home.
