### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Kenai Coyote Brown Nylon Chest Holster for Ruger SP 101](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gunfightersinc-gfi-kenai-rh-ruger-sp-101-gry-coy-kn-sp101-40222" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunfightersinc-gfi-kenai-rh-ruger-sp-101-gry-coy-kn-sp101-40222/public"/></a></div>

As an avid outdoorsman, I've always been on the lookout for reliable gear that enhances my experiences in the wild. Recently, I discovered the GunfightersINC's GFI Kenai RH Ruger SP101 Gry/coy - a chest holster designed specifically for carrying firearms during various outdoor activities.

I'm particularly impressed by the blend of high-quality Kydex and Nylon materials used in its construction. Not only do these materials ensure a secure grip on your weapon but also provide weatherproofing and lightweight comfort - all crucial aspects when you're spending hours outdoors.

One thing I especially appreciate about this holster is its modularity, allowing it to accept attachments like magazine holders or revolver round holders. This flexibility makes it versatile enough to pair with both modern polymer-framed pistols and classic big-bore revolvers alike.

However, as with any product, there are some minor drawbacks. For instance, the initial fitting of the firearm can be a bit tight, requiring some adjustments before it loosens up to allow for a smoother draw. Additionally, the price point may seem steep to some potential users.

Despite these minor issues, I believe that the GunfightersINC's GFI Kenai RH Ruger SP101 Gry/coy offers an unmatched combination of functionality, durability, and stylish design, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about their outdoor adventures. For these reasons, it receives a well-deserved rating of 4.9 stars from this satisfied user.

### [Diehard Ankle Holster for Glock 43/43X](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-43-43x-014pd8bz0-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-gunhide-die-hard-ankle-holster-fits-glock-43-43x-014pd8bz0-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Desantis Gunhide Die Hard Ankle Holster, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer for me. This little holster has made carrying my Glock 43/43X a breeze, and the quality of the materials used is top-notch. The combination of top grain saddle leather and a PU coating not only gives it a sleek appearance but also ensures durability and longevity.

One of my favorite features of this ankle holster is the smooth leather lining. It not only protects my gun's finish but also provides a quick and smooth draw whenever I need it. Plus, the holster itself is meticulously molded, making it both comfortable and stylish to wear.

However, I have experienced a few minor drawbacks with this holster. Firstly, it can get a bit warm when worn for extended periods. Additionally, I feel that the support strap should be included with the holster, rather than being sold separately. Despite these small cons, I cannot deny that the Die Hard Ankle Holster is an excellent choice for anyone looking to carry their Glock in a convenient and secure manner.

### [Ace Case Ambidextrous Belt & Clip Holster for Ruger Pistols](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="ruger-mark-ii-p94-p95-p97-sr9-p345-holster-from-ace-case-made-i-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ruger-mark-ii-p94-p95-p97-sr9-p345-holster-from-ace-case-made-i-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Ruger Mark II, P94, P95, P97. SR9 and P345 Holster from Ace Case for my trusty Ruger. I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, ambidextrous design that allowed me to clip it on either side of my belt. This not only made it incredibly easy to access my weapon but also added an element of comfort to my daily routine.

The holster itself is made of high-quality nylon, making it extremely durable and long-lasting. Its adjustable thumb break feature ensures quick access to my gun when needed, while the 2-inch metal clip can be moved to either side, offering versatility in how I wear it. Plus, the magazine pouch can hold both double-stacked and two single-stacked magazines, which means I'm always prepared for anything.

However, one slightly annoying aspect is that the holster doesn't always stay perfectly secure on my belt, especially during more physically demanding activities. Despite this minor issue, I'm really happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, functional, and stylish holster for their Ruger.

### [Ruger LC9/LC380 Ambidextrous IWB Holster with Under Barrel Laser](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/ruger-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="soft-armor-l-series-ruger-lc9-lc380-with-under-barrel-laser-inside-the-waistband-ambidextrous-holste-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/soft-armor-l-series-ruger-lc9-lc380-with-under-barrel-laser-inside-the-waistband-ambidextrous-holste-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got myself a Soft Armor L Series Ruger LC9/LC380 with Under Barrel Laser Holster and it's been quite a game-changer for me. This holster stands out to me with its tough nylon outer shell and soft tricot interior, offering the perfect balance of security and comfort. Plus, the adjustable thumb break makes it super easy to reach for my weapon quickly. And the best part? It's ambidextrous, so both left and right-handed users can benefit from its features.

One thing that really impresses me about this holster is its flexibility. It can be used as an "In the Pant" holster or a hip holster, all depending on your preference. However, it's important to note that the metal spring clip is meant to be used to stabilize the holster when tucked inside the waistband - not as a traditional holster clip.

On the downside, I've had a little issue with the fit. There's a bit of loose play that doesn't provide the snuggest fit I would prefer, especially when considering the holster's intended purpose. This looseness can sometimes cause the laser button to be accidentally pushed, which can be quite distracting. Overall, the Soft Armor L Series Ruger LC9/LC380 holster is definitely worth considering, but just be aware of those few minor drawbacks.
