Michigan: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Michigan is a shall-issue state where licenses are issued at the local level by county clerks. A Michigan license to purchase a pistol or a background check is required to buy a handgun. Handguns can only be purchased by residents, while non-residents are allowed to purchase long guns. Although there is no firearm registry, all handgun sales require a pistol sales record form to be filed with the Michigan State Police. [[MCL § 28.422](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ovo2lbzmmjnadeztb11oomom))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-28-422)]


### Open Carry and Concealed Carry in Michigan


Open carry is legal in Michigan for residents who are at least 18 years old and who can legally possess a firearm, provided the gun is registered in their name. Non-residents must have a valid concealed carry license from their home state to conceal or open carry. Open carry is allowed in more places than concealed carry as the restricted areas referenced in [Mich. Comp. Laws § 28.425o](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ovo2lbzmmjnadeztb11oomom))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-28-425o) apply to concealed carry.


Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Michigan Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and for non-residents who are at least 21 years old and who have licenses/permits from their state of residency. CPLs require successful completion of a firearms training course that has been state approved with at least eight hours of instruction, including three hours of range time. Some areas are off-limits to concealed carry, including schools and hospitals. [[MCL § 28.425k](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ieplocb5uft2cxi5j0fixoyx))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-28-425k)]


#### Reciprocity


Michigan recognizes resident licenses from all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. [[Michigan State Police](https://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,4643,7-123-1593_3503_4654-10926--,00.html)]


#### Exceptions to CPL Requirement


Michigan Complied Laws Section 28.432a includes a list of individuals that are excepted from requiring a CPL, which includes specific peace officers, members of the military in the line of duty, etc. [[MCL § 28.432a](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ieplocb5uft2cxi5j0fixoyx))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-28-432a&highlight=exempt)]


### Self-Defense


Michigan is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person may use deadly force, with no duty to retreat anywhere he or she has the legal right to be. Any person who uses a gun legitimately in self-defense has immunity from civil liability. An individual not engaged in the commission of a crime may use non-deadly force against another individual anywhere he or she has the legal right to be with no duty to retreat if the person honestly and reasonably believes that the use of that force is necessary to defend himself or herself or another individual from the imminent unlawful use of force by another individual. An individual not engaged in the commission of a crime may use deadly force against another individual anywhere he or she has the legal right to be with no duty to retreat if the person honestly and reasonably believes that the use of that force is necessary to prevent imminent death of or imminent great bodily harm to himself or herself or to another individual, or imminent sexual assault of himself or herself or of another individual. [[MCL § 780.972](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(pjzp1ddu1ykv5mxuq5wpeehb))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-780-972), [780.973](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(pjzp1ddu1ykv5mxuq5wpeehb))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-780-973), [780.974](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(pjzp1ddu1ykv5mxuq5wpeehb))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-780-974)]

To purchase a pistol in a private transaction, the buyer must have a Michigan CPL or LTP. **License to Purchase a Pistol (RI-10 Form)** A License to Purchase a Pistol can only be obtained from your local police or sheriff’s office. You will need a valid Michigan driver’s license or Michigan state ID with your current address listed to get your license.
