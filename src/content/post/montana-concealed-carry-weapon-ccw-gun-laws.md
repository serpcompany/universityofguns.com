Montana: Gun Laws Summary
-------------------------


Montana gun laws allow for permitless carry and no waiting period for purchasing a firearm from a private individual. There is also no firearms registration required, and background checks are only mandated for purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer. Open carry is legal without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. 


Concealed carry is legal without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old that can legally own a firearm in most locations. A permit is required to carry concealed in portions of a building used for state or local government offices and related areas in the building that have been restricted. HB-102, signed into law on February 18, 2021, eliminated many of the prior gun-free zones in the state. See the Location Restrictions section for details. 


### Use of Force In Defense of Occupied Structure


A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the use of force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other person’s unlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure. Deadly force is only justified if the entry is made or attempted and the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent an assault upon the person or another then in the occupied structure or if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony in the occupied structure. 


#### Use of Force in Defense of Person


A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary for self-defense or the defense of another against the other person’s imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is only justified if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to the person or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony. 


#### Self-Defense


Montana is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is lawfully in a place or location and who is threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat from a threat or to summon law enforcement assistance prior to using force.


#### Use of Force In Defense of Other Property


A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another to prevent or terminate the other person’s trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with either real property, other than an occupied structure, or personal property lawfully in the person’s possession or in the possession of another who is a member of the person’s immediate family or household or of a person whose property the person has a legal duty to protect. Deadly force is only justified if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.
