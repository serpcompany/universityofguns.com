### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/public"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is my go-to accessory for my 1911 5" Government. This modular system is perfect for those who like to switch things up and try different carry positions throughout the day. With just a few quick adjustments, I can easily transform the ShapeShift from an IWB holster for casual outings to an OWB paddle holster for more active pursuits.

However, I did encounter some issues with the bulkiness of the holster, especially when using the OWB setup. It's clear that this product is designed with professionals like security personnel or police officers in mind. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and seems a bit wobbly when engaged.

On the positive side, though, the Alien Gear ShapeShift is made in the USA, which is a strong selling point for those who prefer American-made products. And let's not forget the bonus Holster Mount that comes with the Core Carry Pack – it's incredibly versatile and makes it easy to secure my ShapeShift to a variety of surfaces.

In conclusion, while the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack offers a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying positions, it may not be the most comfortable or practical option for everyone. If you're open to trying out various carrying styles and are okay with a slightly bulky design, this product might be worth considering. But if you prioritize comfort and convenience above all else, it might be best to keep looking.

### [Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alien-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, I was excited to try it out. This holster is designed for concealed carry, which is perfect for my everyday safety needs. The injection-molded shell sets it apart from traditional Kydex, offering a hard and durable case for my firearm.

One of the standout features of this holster is its versatility. It's suitable for several carrying positions, including strong-side carry and appendix carry. Additionally, the canted grip angle can be adjusted to your preference. Plus, the ride height on your belt is customizable too, allowing you to find the perfect balance between concealment and accessibility.

However, this holster does have its drawbacks. After using it for a while, I found that the carry claw and muzzle wedge, while included, didn't offer much improvement in terms of comfort or concealment. The holster is made in the USA, which is a positive point, but it's not enough to compensate for these issues.

Overall, while the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster does offer a few good things like adjustability and durability, the issues with fit and clearance make it a less-than-ideal choice for me. I'd recommend looking into other options if you're in the market for a new holster.
