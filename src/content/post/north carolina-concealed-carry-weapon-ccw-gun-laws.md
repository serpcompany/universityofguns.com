## North Carolina: Gun Laws Summary

North Carolina is a shall-issue state with concealed handgun permits issued at the county level by the local sheriff’s office.

Open carry is legal in North Carolina without a permit. Counties may regulate the display of firearms on public roads, sidewalks, alleys or other public property. The minimum age is 18 years old. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and the State Capitol grounds.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a North Carolina Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and for non-residents with any valid license/permit. North Carolina CHP’s are issued to residents and members of the military permanently posted in North Carolina and require a firearms training course that has been approved by the state. The minimum age is 21 years old. In terms of reciprocity, North Carolina recognizes permits from all states, regardless of the age of the permit holder.

### Use of Force

A person is justified in using force, except deadly force, when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other’s imminent use of unlawful force.

#### Immunity from Liability

Force which is intended or likely to cause death or bodily injury is immune from civil or criminal liability or the wrongful death of a person against whom such force was used if the use of such force was justified.

[N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 14-51.2](https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-14-criminal-law/nc-gen-st-sect-14-51-2.html) and [§ 14-51.3](https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-14-criminal-law/nc-gen-st-sect-14-51-3.html)

#### Self-Defense

North Carolina is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” statute.

A person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat in any place a person has the lawful right to be if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another; or if a person is in one’s home, vehicle or workplace and provided that the person against whom the defensive force was used was an unlawful intruder or was attempting to forcibly and unlawfully enter.

#### Use of Deadly Force

A person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat in any place he or she has the lawful right to be if either of the following applies:

- The person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.

The lawful occupant of a home, motor vehicle or workplace is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or herself or another when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to another if both of the following apply:

- The person against whom the defensive force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering or had unlawfully and forcibly entered a home, motor vehicle or workplace, or that person had removed or was attempting to remove another against that person’s will from the home, motor vehicle or workplace; and
- The person who uses defensive force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring or had occurred.

“Home” is defined as a building or conveyance of any kind, including its curtilage, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it, including a tent, and is designed as a temporary or permanent residence.
