<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="glock-26-27-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-g26-g27-ho-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glock-26-27-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband-g26-g27-ho-1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for the Glock 26/27 is an exceptional holster that provides a secure fit and easy draw. The adjustable retention feature is a standout, allowing you to customize the tightness of the holster around your firearm. The versatile mounting pattern makes it compatible with a wide range of attachments, making it highly convenient for users.

The optic ready speed cut enables quick and efficient drawing of the pistol when needed, while the high-strength, heat-resistant polymer construction ensures durability over time. Precision molding results in a perfect fit for my Glock, showcasing the attention to detail in manufacturing.

Overall, using this holster has been a positive experience due to its security, compatibility, and build quality. It is an excellent choice for anyone looking to carry their firearm outside the waistband with ease and comfort.

### [Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for Springfield XD-M 5.25](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/springfield-xd-m-5-25-owb-holster-usa-made-signature-owb-holster-right-handed-outside-the-waistband--1/public"/></a></div>

The Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster has truly lived up to its reputation when it comes to my Springfield XD-M 5. 25". Constructed with a strong proprietary mix of polymers, the durability and rigidity are top-notch. The IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut helps me efficiently clear the muzzle out of the holster, while precision molding ensures a perfect fit for my firearm.

One feature I greatly appreciate is the positive locking trigger guard that provides tactile feedback, giving me peace of mind that my firearm is secure. Additionally, the adjustable retention allows me to customize the fit for my gun as needed. Compatible with multiple belt attachments, this holster is clearly a favorite in competitive shooting circles.

However, there are some minor downsides worth mentioning. Some users have mentioned that out-of-the-box retention can be too tight but can be easily adjusted via screws. Adding or removing from your normal belt may also be difficult due to a fixed secondary security lock piece - though this isn't an issue if you're using a two-sided belt instead.

Overall, I highly recommend this product as it has provided fast draw capabilities and secure retention during intense training sessions and competitions alike, making it reliable and durable in construction at the same time!

### [IWB Glock 42 Holster for Comfortable Everyday Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="klipt-iwb-glock-42-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klipt-iwb-glock-42-holster-right-handed-inside-the-waistband-klipt-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for the Glock 42 for several weeks and I must say, it's become my go-to holster. The design is sleek and slim, perfect for everyday carry without adding any bulk to my outfit. The high sweat guard is a game-changer, keeping me comfortable even when I sweat, while also protecting against slide serrations.

The belt clip is a breeze to use and keeps my holster securely attached to my belt until I need to remove it. Retention on this holster is excellent - with built-in retention and positive lock trigger guard, I always feel confident that my firearm is held securely in place.

A big bonus is that this holster is made in the USA with high strength, heat resistant polymer that molds precisely to fit my gun snugly. Overall, the Blade-Tech Klipt IWB Holster for the Glock 42 has exceeded my expectations for an everyday carry solution.

### [Adjustable Right Hand OWB Holster for Small Revolvers](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="snapslide-owb-holster-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/snapslide-owb-holster-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

The SnapSlide and DropSlide holsters both offer a comfortable, secure fit for my firearms. I appreciate the adjustable retention on both, which allows me to customize the level of security and ease of access. The leather construction makes them comfortable against my skin and doesn't cause any irritation. The lower mounting position of the DropSlide makes it easier to draw from, but it can be more difficult to conceal the muzzle. On the other hand, the SnapSlide offers better concealment but requires a little more effort to draw from. Overall, both options are solid choices depending on your specific needs - whether it be ease of drawing or superior concealment.

### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for CZ Shadow 2](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cz-shadow-2-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cz-shadow-2-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for my CZ Shadow 2 and it has become a reliable companion in my daily carry routine. The adjustable retention feature is a game changer, as it allows me to customize the fit of the holster around my firearm, ensuring that it stays snugly in place throughout the day.

The optic ready speed cut design is another fantastic feature, giving me an edge during competitive situations while still being IDPA & USPSA legal. I appreciate how this holster offers compatibility with Blade-Tech's wide range of Outside the Waistband attachments, allowing me to tailor its draw and ride according to my personal preferences.

Initially, I did face some difficulty tightening or loosening the screws due to them spinning on their posts. However, after following customer support's advice of using rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer, I was able to resolve this issue – although others may find this frustrating. Additionally, some users might desire wider belt loops for added comfort when carrying their weapon.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I am overall satisfied with the quality and durability of this holster - made from high strength Boltaron here in the USA - as well as Blade-Tech's lifetime guarantee on craftsmanship issues which provides peace of mind knowing that it will last for years to come.

### [Adjustable CZ P09 OWB Holster for Competition & Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cz-p09-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cz-p09-owb-holster-right-handed-cz-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

As a gun enthusiast, I've tested and tried many holsters over the years, and after a week of using the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for the CZ P-09, I must say it exceeded my expectations. The high-quality precision molding gave my firearm a snug fit while still providing an easy draw when needed. The adjustable retention feature allowed me to customize the fit of my gun in the holster for maximum security and convenience.

One of my favorite features is the IDPA and USPSA legal optic ready speed cut, which allows me to quickly clear the muzzle during draws. This has proven quite helpful during competitions or while carrying concealed. The durable Boltaron material can endure extensive wear without adding any bulk to your carry setup.

On a downside, some users mentioned difficulty with screw adjustments due to spinning posts; however, this was not my personal experience with this product. Additionally, there were concerns about compatibility with certain optics on firearms that might require modifications or replacement parts for a reliable fit – something worth double checking before purchase. But overall, customers are happy with their purchase as indicated by its high ratings (4. 7) and positive reviews (92%).

In conclusion, if you're someone who demands precision performance from your holsters like I do – Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster delivers just that!

### [Adjustable Outside the Waistband Holster for Browning Hi-Power 9mm](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="browning-hi-power-9-owb-holster-right-handed-browning-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-hi-power-9-owb-holster-right-handed-browning-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for Browning Hi-Power 9mm and have been using it for a few weeks. Overall, I'm quite impressed with its performance. The holster is crafted in the USA from high-strength Boltaron material, providing excellent durability.

One standout feature is the adjustable retention screws, which allow you to easily customize the fit of your firearm in the holster. This ensures a secure hold while still allowing for smooth and quick access when needed. The positive locking trigger guard adds an extra layer of safety by giving you tactile feedback when securing your firearm.

The IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design allows for quick clearance from the muzzle out of the holster, which could give a competitive edge during competitions – though I haven't had the chance to test this due to COVID restrictions. However, practicing dry firing with this holster has shown how smoothly my gun slides in and out of it.

My only minor issue was some discomfort while wearing it on my belt for extended periods when sitting down – this was resolved by adjusting where I positioned it slightly higher on my waistband (at around 4 o'clock). This may not be an issue if you are able to make similar adjustments or prefer appendix carry (which I don’t generally use).

Overall, this is a high-quality product that delivers on its promises - fitting snugly against your body while offering easy access and reholstering capabilities. Highly recommended for anyone looking into purchasing one!

### [Adjustable OWB Holster for 1911 Commander 4.25](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/25-auto-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="1911-commander-4-25-owb-holster-right-handed-1911-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1911-commander-4-25-owb-holster-right-handed-1911-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

As someone who values high-quality craftsmanship and reliability in their holsters, I was excited to try out the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for the 1911 4. 25" Commander. I must say, this holster did not disappoint.

One of my favorite aspects of this product is its precision fit and adjustment capabilities. The Boltaron construction provides a snug yet flexible fit around your firearm, while the retention screws allow for easy customization according to your preferences. This level of customization ensures that you can carry your firearm with confidence throughout the day, knowing it's securely stored and ready to be drawn when needed.

Another standout feature is the IDPA and USPSA legal optic ready speed cut design which makes clearing the muzzle out of the holster quick and efficient during competition practices - perfect for anyone looking to gain an edge in their competitive shooting events! Additionally, this holster features a positive locking trigger guard that offers tactile feedback so you always know when your gun is safely stored in place.

However, there has been some feedback from other users about spinning adjustment screws making adjustments difficult without additional tools like rubber bands or hand sanitizer. Although my personal experience didn't involve any such issues with this product, it's something potential buyers should be aware of as well as possible solutions such as using thread locker or adding a small spacer if they encounter similar difficulties during setup or attachment use (for example with ASR mounting hardware).

Overall though - most reviewers seem highly satisfied by both build quality & performance offered here! So despite these minor reported inconveniences by other users who may have experienced them – overall satisfaction still appears relatively consistent among those who have tried out this particular model themselves too!

### What is the difference between an appendix carry and a standard IWB carry?

An appendix carry positions your firearm in front of your hip (usually between the 1:00 and 2:00 clock positions), while a standard IWB carry positions the firearm at the 3:00 or 4:00 clock positions along your waistline. Appendixt carry is generally more concealable and accessible for some users, but it may be less comfortable or more difficult to reholster depending on individual preferences and body types.

### How can I determine the right size of an auto holster for my firearm?

To determine the right size of an auto holster for your firearm, consider the following steps: 1. Review the manufacturer's sizing chart or compatibility information, which can typically be found in the product description.

2. Consult customer reviews and product images to see if other users with the same firearm as yours have found success with the holster in question.

3. If available, use a template or sizing guide provided by the manufacturer to assess the fit of your firearm within the holster.

Remember that some holsters may offer adjustability features, such as belt loops or clips, that can further customize the fit to your specific requirements.

### How do I choose the right retention level for my gun holster?

2. Your preferred method of access or draw style (e. g. , speed vs. security).

3. Your level of experience and familiarity with different retention systems.

Be sure to review the features and benefits of each retention level to determine which one will best meet your needs and preferences.
