Hawaii: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------


If you are a gun owner in Hawaii or are planning on becoming one, it is important to be aware of the state's gun laws to ensure your safety and avoid legal trouble. Hawaii is now a shall-issue state since the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen on June 23rd, 2022. This means that permits are issued by the Chief of Police at the county level.


### Permits and Registration


A permit to purchase, a background check, and firearms registration are required to buy a handgun from a private individual. There is a minimum 14-day wait when applying for a purchase permit. All firearms and ammunition must be registered with the chief of police of the county of one’s place of business, one’s residence, or one’s place of sojourn (temporary place of lodging). Non-residents may transport a firearm to the state provided they possess a hunting license, shooting preserve permit or invitation to shoot on private land, or written notification from a firing range indicating the person will engage in target shooting. Any firearms must be registered at a police station within 72 hours of arrival. Current law requires fingerprinting and having a photograph taken. A license is provided for each firearm/make/model/serial number.


#### Open and Concealed Carry


Hawaii permits open carry and concealed carry of handguns on the person with a Hawaii license to carry, which is only valid in the county of issue. The minimum age is 21 years old. Carrying a loaded firearm without a license to carry, whether openly or concealed, including in a vehicle, is a class B felony. Concealed carry licenses require a firearms training course that has been state-approved. The state and county of Hawaii have sought rehearing of the Young v. Hawaii court case by the Ninth Circuit due to Hawaii’s restrictive handgun permitting policies. In terms of reciprocity, Hawaii does not issue non-resident licenses nor does it honor CCW licenses from any other state.


#### Use of Force in Self-Protection


A person acting in self-defense may estimate the amount of force necessary under the circumstances as he or she believes them to be when the force is used without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act which one has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action. The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this section if the actor knows that he or she can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying with a demand that one abstain from any action which he or she has no duty to take, except that the actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of work, unless he or she was the initial aggressor or is assailed in the place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be.


#### Self-Defense


Hawaii is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no duty to retreat inside one’s home or place of business. Outside of those locations, there is a duty to retreat if it can be done in “complete safety.”


#### Use of Force for the Protection of Other Persons


The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable to protect a third person when the actor believes the person whom the actor seeks to protect would be justified in using such protective force and the actor believes that the actor’s intervention is necessary for the protection of the other person. The same requirements to retreat, to surrender the possession of a thing, or to comply with a demand apply to protection of another as in self-defense.


#### Use of Force for the Protection of Property


The use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary to prevent unlawful entry, trespass or burglary in a building or upon real property in the actor’s possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the actor acts and to prevent theft, criminal mischief, or any taking of tangible, movable property in the actor’s possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the actor acts. The actor may use such force as the actor believes is necessary to protect the threatened property, provided that the actor first requests the person against whom force is used to desist from the person’s interference with the property, unless the actor believes that such a request would be useless, it would be dangerous to the actor or another person to make the request, or substantial harm would be done to the physical condition of the property which is sought to be protected before the request could effectively be made. The use of deadly force for the protection of property is justifiable only if the person against whom the force is used is attempting to dispossess the actor of the actor’s dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession or commit felonious property damage, burglary, robbery or felonious theft and either has employed or threatened deadly force against or in the presence of the actor or the use of force other than deadly force to prevent the commission of the crime would expose the actor or another person in the actor’s presence to substantial danger of serious bodily injury.
