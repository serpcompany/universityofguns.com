<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gordon-8-in-survival-hunting-knife-1/public"/></a></div>

Having used this survival knife for my outdoor adventures, I can confidently say that it's a versatile tool that won't let you down. The 8-inch stainless steel blade is built for cutting, chopping, and sawing, making it a dependable option for campers and hikers alike. A noteworthy feature is the included compass and survival kit tucked inside the handle, which transforms this product into an all-inclusive survival package.

I was impressed by the hollow handle design, as it not only reduces weight but also allows room to store additional items such as fishing gear or fire starters. The knife comes with a sharp edge right out of the box and maintains its sharpness well even after heavy usage. The serrated area on top of the blade provides extra functionality when sawing through tough materials like wood or bone.

Some users have reported issues with the screw that connects the handle to the blade becoming loose; however, using epoxy glue appears to be an effective solution for this issue as suggested by other reviewers. Despite these concerns, many users have expressed satisfaction with their overall experience with this high-quality survival knife at an affordable price point. In conclusion, I highly recommend this knife to anyone in search of a reliable tool for their outdoor adventures!

The handle design provides just enough friction without being too slippery or uncomfortable during extended use which was great for long days out in nature.

While some may find its size a bit large for everyday carry purposes (EDC), I think this decision fits well considering its primary function as an all-purpose outdoorsman tool. I also appreciate how rugged this knife feels despite being so sleek in appearance – no matter what adventure you take it on!

I also appreciate the oversized lanyard hole that lets me easily attach a cord or lanyard for added security during use or transportation. The drop point blade made from CPM-S35VN steel is sharp right out of the box and retains its edge well over time with minimal maintenance required. This makes it perfect for a variety of tasks like slicing through rope or cutting open packages with ease. The satin finish gives the blade an understated yet stylish look that adds to its appeal as an Everyday Carry (EDC) tool/knife; whether you're camping, hiking, fishing, hunting - you name it!

### [Stainless Steel Bowie Knife for Camping, Hunting, and Outdoor Activities](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="gordon-6-in-bowie-knife-58091" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gordon-6-in-bowie-knife-58091/public"/></a></div>

As a frequent outdoorsman, I recently had the chance to test out the Bowie Knife on my camping and hunting trips. Its stainless steel blade construction has been reliable, providing both strength and durability for piercing and cutting in tight spaces. The 10-1/2 inch overall length offers a comfortable grip while allowing me to maneuver easily during use.

One of the most appealing features of this knife is its versatility - it excels as a fixed blade knife for camping and hunting purposes, but also serves well as a boot knife due to its sleek design and compact size. The sheath that accompanies the knife is made of quality leather with a polymer insert, which provides peace of mind knowing that the blade won't accidentally penetrate while it's not in use. However, there were instances where play can be felt on the handle after prolonged usage, something worth considering depending on your needs.

Overall, the Bowie Knife has become an essential piece of gear in my collection thanks to its affordability combined with solid performance. Its versatility makes it an excellent choice for anyone seeking value without compromising quality in their equipment.

### [Outdoor Edge SwingBlade: Versatile Hunting Knife with Skinning and Gutting Blades](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I recently purchased the SwingBlade knife from Outdoor Edge for my hunting trips, and I am thrilled with my experience. The most impressive feature of this hunting knife is its dual-blade design, including a drop-point skinner blade and a gutting blade. Both blades are sharp out of the box and remain so even after multiple uses.

The ergonomic handle design is another standout attribute, as it provides a secure grip even when wet or bloody. Furthermore, the bright orange handle makes it easy to locate in case of accidental drops in the field.

The nylon belt sheath secures the knife firmly while also offering quick access when needed. My interactions with Outdoor Edge's customer service have been nothing short of exceptional - they quickly resolved an issue I had with a missing knob on my knife by sending me a replacement without any hassle at all!

Although pushing the button to change between blades can be challenging for those with larger hands like mine, this minor inconvenience does not detract from the overall value and performance of the product.

### [Rotating Blade Survival Knife for Hunting and Outdoor Activities](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="outdoor-edge-swingblade-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/outdoor-edge-swingblade-black-1/public"/></a></div>

The Swingblaze Skinning and Gutting Knife has quickly become my go-to tool for hunting trips, thanks to its versatile, innovative design. With a simple push of a button, it effortlessly switches between the drop-point skinner blade and gutting blade, allowing me to easily maneuver in tight spaces. The AUS-8 stainless steel blades are incredibly sharp out of the box and maintain their edge impressively well, even after working with tough hides. The Kraton handle provides a solid grip that stays secure even when my hands are wet or covered in blood from dressing out an animal.

One of my favorite aspects of this knife is its unique underside cutting action on the gutting blade, which makes quick work of field dressing game without any risk of tearing into internal organs or hairs along the way. This has significantly improved my hunting experience by saving time and reducing frustration during field dressing. Overall, if you're looking for an all-rounder hunting knife that can handle multiple tasks with ease - look no further than Outdoor Edge’s SwingBlade Skinning & Gutting Knife!

### [Large Hunting Knife with Brass Bolsters and Genuine Ebony Handle](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="buck-knives-ranger-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/buck-knives-ranger-1/public"/></a></div>

The Buck Ranger 112 has become a go-to choice for my daily tasks, and I have found it to be a durable and reliable knife. The 420HC stainless steel clip blade with a satin finish makes it robust, while the Crelicam genuine ebony handle with brass bolsters provides an elegant touch and comfortable grip.

One highlight is the inclusion of a genuine leather sheath that not only protects the knife but also adds to its overall appeal. The back locking mechanism ensures secure blade locking during use, and the 760mm blade length is ideal for most tasks.

However, there are some minor drawbacks. Some users reported tightness upon first usage due to buffing compound residue needing lube washes for resolution. Additionally, there may be inconsistencies in finishing on scales depending on specific units, though this does not affect functionality or reliability. Although marketed as a hunting knife, its weight could make it less ideal for everyday carry compared to lighter options available today - but many users found alternative uses in camping or tactical situations where its heavier yet robust build was appreciated.

In summary, if you're looking for a reliable stainless steel folding knife made in the USA that offers classic design elements with modern functionality, then investing in Buck Ranger 112 would be worth considering given its balance of pros and cons based on user experiences detailed above!

### [SK-5 High Carbon Steel Fixed Blade Knife for Survival and Tactical Use](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-knives?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cold-steel-srk-sk-6" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cold-steel-srk-sk-6/public"/></a></div>

After using the Cold Steel SRK (Survival Rescue Knife) daily for a few weeks, I've found it to be an incredibly reliable and versatile tool. One of my favorite aspects is its compact size, making it easy to carry around in various situations. The SK-5 high carbon steel blade provides excellent edge retention while the clip point shape makes it effective for cutting rope or slicing food with precision. The handle is made of Kray-Ex material, which offers a comfortable and secure grip.

While overall I am very satisfied with this product, there is room for improvement in the sheath design. After extended use, it tends to loosen up causing the knife to rattle around. This may not be a deal breaker for some but could be frustrating if you are relying on this knife in critical situations. Despite this minor flaw, the Cold Steel SRK is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a dependable everyday carry knife; just consider investing in an aftermarket sheath for better security.

The Tom Brown Tracker #2 is a 5-inch fixed-blade knife with a 1095 carbon steel blade and black traction coating. Its overall weight of just 9. 6oz makes it portable and versatile for outdoor adventures or everyday carry. The handle is made from secure, comfortable black linen micarta, while the back of the blade features a saw for cutting through thick materials like branches or bone.

During my experience with this knife, I found that its performance truly stands out - it slices through materials effortlessly and holds its edge incredibly well, making tasks such as skinning game or processing wood much easier. Additionally, the included Kydex sheath provides multiple carrying options to suit various situations. However, one potential drawback is that some users may find the weight distribution slightly off due to its smaller size compared to other models in the series.

Overall, I would recommend the Tom Brown Tracker #2 as a high-quality fixed-blade knife with exceptional performance and design for anyone in search of this type of tool. Just keep in mind that it might be better suited for those who prefer lighter-weight knives with shorter blades.

### General Advice

- Choose Quality: Invest in a high-quality knife from a reputable manufacturer. A well-made knife will last longer and perform better than cheaper alternatives.

- Practice Proper Safety: Always handle knives with care, and learn the proper techniques for using and maintaining them safely.

- Consider Additional Tools: While a good hunting knife is essential, consider adding other tools like game saws, filet knives, or multi-tools to your hunting gear arsenal.
