As a reviewer who has used the product, I found it to be an excellent choice for carrying outside the waistband due to its durability, compatibility with various attachment options, and precision molding.

I've been using the Blade-Tech Signature OWB Holster for my S&W - M&P Shield 9/40/Plus for several months, and I'm impressed with its performance. The holster is made from a strong, heat-resistant polymer that feels long-lasting and durable.

A favorite feature of mine is the positive locking trigger guard – it gives me peace of mind knowing my firearm is securely in place with a tactile feedback when it's locked in. The adjustable retention allows me to customize the fit around my gun without being too tight or loose.

The IDPA legal Optic Ready Speed Cut makes it easy to draw quickly during training or competitions. Plus, being able to switch up carry positions with compatible belt attachments is super convenient. The precision molding results in a snug and comfortable hold that doesn't add unnecessary bulk to my carry setup.

One challenge I faced was adjusting the tension on the holster, as there were no specific instructions provided and only two screws available for adjustment. However, after some trial and error, I found the perfect balance between security and smooth draw action. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase but would appreciate more detailed instructions from Blade-Tech in future models or product guides online!

### [ComfortTac Ultimate Belly Band Holster for Right-Hand Draw](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mic-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/mic-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-regular-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comforttac-belly-band-holster-right-hand-draw-size-regular-black-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster for several weeks, I have found it to be a great concealed carry option. The design allows for smooth and fast draws while keeping your firearm securely in place. One of the notable features is its versatility; it comes in three sizes that cater to different body types, and can be worn in various positions according to personal preferences. The built-in pocket is also handy, providing extra space to carry magazines or small essentials like keys or ID cards.

The breathable neoprene band is comfortable to wear even during hot days, which is a big plus for warm climate dwellers. However, larger weapons can make the holster uncomfortable as they press against the body more noticeably than smaller ones do. Also, this holster doesn't offer much storage space besides an extra magazine or two, so if you need additional storage capacity, this might not be the best choice for you.

In conclusion, I am pleased with my experience using the ComfortTac Belly Band Holster due to its easy accessibility and discretion combined with convenience. It may have some minor downsides but overall it's a solid product worth trying out!
