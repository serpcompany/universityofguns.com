<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-gong-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="3-8-ar500-steel-gong-shooting-target-sale-clearance-ash-ember-titan-outdoors-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/3-8-ar500-steel-gong-shooting-target-sale-clearance-ash-ember-titan-outdoors-1/public"/></a></div>

The Titan Great Outdoors 10-in x 16-in AR500 Silhouette Steel Plate Shooting Target has exceeded my expectations in terms of durability and functionality. The thick steel plate construction ensures that it withstands powerful rifle ammo hits, and its sturdy build adds to its longevity. I appreciate the clear ringing sound upon impact which offers instant feedback on my shots, enhancing my overall shooting accuracy.

Compared to other similar products, this target is competitively priced, and the fact that it doesn't have a powder coat saves money without compromising its performance. One minor downside is the absence of mounting holes, but there are creative ways to securely mount the target. Overall, it's a highly recommended product for anyone looking to improve their shooting skills while having a fun time at the range!

The 1/2" AR 500 Steel Armor Plate Target is a fantastic option for those looking to spice up their shooting practice. Its precision-cut holes make hanging it up effortlessly, while its raw steel construction ensures durability even with constant fire. One standout feature is its manufacturing process, which involves cutting with a CNC High Definition plasma cutter for precise edges and shapes, resulting in an impressive end product that can withstand powerful ammunition without visible wear.

Additionally, the target offers multiple hanging options – through chains, bolts, clevises, cable or rope - making setup easy and customizable. However, if left unused for extended periods outside the elements, surface rust may develop due to raw steel. A fresh coat of spray paint should keep it new-looking for years.

Overall, this target is a great investment for enhancing shooting skills or having fun on range days with friends and family. The quality craftsmanship guarantees long-lasting use and customization at an affordable price point. Remember to always wear proper safety gear when using steel targets and follow recommended minimum distances when shooting pistols or rifles at them.

### What's the difference between an impact zone and a risk zone on a steel gong target?

The impact zone is the area of the target that's meant to be shot at, typically the gong itself. The risk zone extends beyond this and includes areas that could potentially be hit by wayward shots, increasing the risk of the target or surrounding area being damaged.

### How far away should I be when shooting at a steel gong target?

The safe distance varies depending on the caliber and power of the gun, as well as the size and thickness of the target. As a general guideline, stand at least 100 yards away when shooting at a steel gong target.
