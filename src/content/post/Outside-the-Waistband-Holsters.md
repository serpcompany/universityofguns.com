## Buyer's Guide

### Features to Consider

When looking for an outside the waistband (OWB) holster, it's important to consider several key features:

- Retention: Make sure the holster securely holds your handgun in place while also allowing you to draw it quickly.

- Comfort: Ensure that the holster is comfortable to wear for extended periods.

- Material: Choose a durable material like leather or kydex that can withstand regular use.

- Concealment: Decide if you want a holster designed for open or concealed carry.

- Adjustability: Look for a holster that allows you to adjust cant and tension to fit your drawing style.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/outside-the-waistband-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Outside+the+Waistband+Holsters-2/public" alt="Outside the Waistband Holsters-2"></a></div>

### Types of OWB Holsters

There are several types of OWB holsters to choose from:

- Pancake Holsters: These holsters have two straps that hold them against your body, offering good retention.

- Slide Holsters: Slide holsters use a single strap and are easier to conceal than pancake holsters.

- Adjustable Holsters: These holsters allow you to adjust cant and tension for better comfort and concealment.

### Choosing the Right Material

OWB holsters are typically made from leather or kydex:

- Leather: Leather holsters are comfortable, durable, and have a classic look. However, they may require more maintenance and can stretch over time.

- Kydex: Kydex holsters are lightweight and don't stretch, making them easy to maintain. Some shooters prefer the rigid structure of kydex, but others find it less comfortable than leather.

### Concealed Carry OWB Holsters

For those who carry concealed, consider the following factors:

- Clothing: Choose clothing that helps conceal your handgun while still allowing easy access.

- Waistline Coverage: Opt for a holster that covers at least half of your waistline for better concealment.

- Retention: Ensure your holster is secure enough to prevent the accidental disclosure of your handgun when bending or sitting.

### Buyer's Guide Summary

When shopping for an OWB holster, prioritize retention, comfort, material durability, concealment capabilities, and adjustability.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you'll be well-equipped to find the perfect OWB holster for your needs.
