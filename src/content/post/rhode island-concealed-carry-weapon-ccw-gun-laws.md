Rhode Island: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------------


Rhode Island is a shall-issue state by state law but the attorney general “may-issue” licenses as well. Licenses to carry concealed weapons are issued at the local level by the police chief or by the attorney general.


Under Rhode Island law, local law enforcement “shall-issue” licenses to eligible applicants “if it appears” that the applicant is “a suitable person to be licensed” and either “has good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property” or has any other “proper reason” for carrying a handgun. [[11-47-11](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-47/11-47-11.HTM)]


The Rhode Island attorney general also “may-issue” a license to carry a handgun, “concealed or not,” to a person age 21 or older who makes a “proper showing of need” for the license and has certification of his or her ability to use the handgun. The attorney-general-issued license, unlike that issued by local authorities, can also be granted to undocumented persons. [[11-47-11.1](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-47/11-47-11.1.HTM)]


### Self-Defense


Rhode Island is a Castle Doctrine state. Rhode Island law states the owner, tenant or occupier of a place has no duty to retreat and can engage a threat with reasonable means of self-defense.


#### Presumed Self-Defense


It is presumed as a matter of law in any civil or criminal proceeding that the owner, tenant or occupier of a place where a criminal offense was committed acted by reasonable means in self-defense and in the reasonable belief that the person engaged in the criminal offense was about to inflict great bodily harm or death upon that person or any other individual lawfully in the place where the criminal offense was committed. There shall be no duty on the part of an owner, tenant or occupier to retreat from any person engaged in the commission of any criminal offense enumerated in §§ 11-8-2 – 11-8-6, which includes: Breaking or entering a dwelling house, apartment, building or garage; or Intent to commit murder, sexual assault, robbery, arson or larceny. [[11-8-8](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-8/11-8-8.HTM)]

To pass, you must score at least an 80 percent. After achieving a passing score, your Blue Card will arrive by mail. Active military personnel may waive the handgun safety exam requirement and obtain a Blue Card by presenting their Military ID at either the RIDEM Division of Fish & Wildlife Great Swamp Field Headquarters or RIDEM Headquarters at 235 Promenade Street, Providence, Rhode Island. When purchasing your handgun, whether through a private transaction or through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), you will need to complete a Purchase of a Pistol or Revolver Application Form. There is a 7-day waiting period after filing this form with the State Police, during which a background check in completed. If you are approved, you may pick up your firearm after the waiting period has passed. |
