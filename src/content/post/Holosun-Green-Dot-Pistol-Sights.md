### [HHA Optimizer Ultra x Sight for Precise Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hha-optimizer-ultra-x-sight-5019-019-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hha-optimizer-ultra-x-sight-5019-019-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Introducing the HHA Optimizer Ultra X, a single-pin bow sight that's designed to bring precision to your shooting game. I've been using this for quite some time now and it's been an amazing addition to my bow hunting gear. Its standout features include the R. D. S sight tape technology, 20-80 yard tapes in single yard increments, the Infinite Adjust Slotted Slide Bracket, and 2nd axis adjustments, all of which are made in the USA.

The Optimizer Ultra X is known for its "to-the-yard" precision, a feature that's held it in good stead with hunters and archers alike for nearly two decades. It's been an reliable friend in my hunting expeditions, keeping up with the rigors of outdoor adventures and still maintaining its accuracy. The popularity of single-pin sights is at an all-time high and I can see why. The Ultra X, with its high visibility fiber, makes it a piece of cake to take quick shots.

One of the things that appealed to me the most is its rugged design. It's been through some rough times with me and it's still going strong. Another notable feature is the Machined aluminum pin carrier, which adds to the durability of the product. And when it comes to accuracy, this sight has been consistent, even under low light conditions, making it a go-to choice for those misty or dawn shootouts.

However, there were a few things I found slightly disappointing. The windage adjustments didn't seem to cover as much ground as I would've liked, making it tough to find the right balance. Also, the blueburst light that comes with the sight didn't last as long as I expected it to.

Nonetheless, the HHA Optimizer Ultra X has been a game-changer for me. Its high-visibility fiber makes shooting in low light conditions a breeze. Its accuracy, along with its easy-to-use windage and elevation adjustments, makes it a winner. If you're looking to up your bow hunting game, the HHA Optimizer Ultra X is definitely worth a shot.

### [Landslyde Carbon Plus Picatinny Slider Sight](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axcel-landslyde-plus-carbon-pro-sight-av-31-1-pin-019-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-landslyde-plus-carbon-pro-sight-av-31-1-pin-019-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Axcel Landslyde Plus Sight, and I've got a handful of thoughts to share. First off, it's a well-built piece of equipment that definitely gets the job done. However, there are a couple of drawbacks with this sight that's worth mentioning.

First off, the fibers on the pins are completely unprotected, which can be a risk for hunters. It's a small detail, but it definitely stands out. Secondly, it's loaded with screws, which could potentially loosen up. Lastly, the brightness of the fibers aren't the best, especially if you're using the. 010.

Despite the drawbacks, the Axcel Landslyde Plus Sight is still a reliable piece of equipment. It's got adjustable pointers for quick adjustments, precise yardage and windage adjustments, and first, second, and third axis adjustments. It's not perfect, but it's a solid choice for anyone in need of a new sight.

### [AccuHunter 41mm Single Pin Slider Sight](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axcel-accuhunter-picatinny-sight-41mm-1-pin-019-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-accuhunter-picatinny-sight-41mm-1-pin-019-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Axcel AccuHunter Picatinny Sight 41mm 1 Pin. 010 Green RH/LH, and let me tell you, it's been quite an adventure! This slider sight is every archer's dream come true with its rapid adjust knob and quick release feature.

The highlight for me was how smooth the sight slides along the whisper quiet gear teeth for precise yardage settings. I didn't have to worry about any loud clanking noises that could scare away my prey. Plus, the adjustable 20-yard dead stop is a game-changer. With it, I can quickly dial back my shots at 20, 30, or 40 yards in just a matter of seconds.

Another feature that I absolutely love is the 45-degree rear-facing sight tape. It encourages me to keep my bow arm extended, reducing unnecessary movements while aiming. Additionally, the True first, second, and third axis adjustments provide superb accuracy for my shots. And oh boy, that push-button windage lock? Talk about peace of mind knowing that my sight won't get messed up accidentally!

However, one minor drawback that I discovered is that the pins on the AV Hunter scope could be slightly more vibrant. Although they are still quite bright, a little more brightness would have made my shooting experience even better.

Overall, the Axcel AccuHunter Picatinny Sight has undoubtedly improved my accuracy and elevated my overall archery experience. Its high-quality features and smooth performance make it worth every penny.

I remember the first time I used the Axcel AccuHunter Plus Sight on my bow for a hunting trip. The single pin design made it incredibly easy to track my targets, even in low light situations, with the help of its green. 010 reticle. Its adjustability, allowing for fine-tuning of windage and elevation, was a game-changer, helping me hit my mark with precision every time.

One of the features that stood out for me was the dead stop 20-yard marker. It allowed me to set and forget, giving me the confidence to take shots without worrying about minor adjustments. Another highlight was the inclusion of the AV Plus scope with a crosshair aiming reticle - it provided excellent clarity and accuracy.

However, there were a few cons too. The setup process was a bit complex and it took me some time to get used to it. Additionally, the sight tape for yardage adjustments wasn't as user-friendly as I'd hoped.

Overall, despite a few hiccups, the Axcel AccuHunter Plus Sight has greatly improved my shooting experience. Its accuracy and adaptability make it a worthy addition to any hunter's arsenal.

### [Axcel Accutouch HD Single Pin Sight with Accu-Click System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/holosun-green-dot-pistol-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

The 45-degree rear-facing sight tape also helps me keep track of where my yardage indicator is set.

One of the things that I love about this sight is how easy it is to make adjustments. Whether it's the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd axis, I don't need any shims to get things just right. The micro-adjust windage is another highlight - it stays locked in place until I release it with the windage lock button.

The included Axcel AV-31 scope comes in either a. 019 or. 010 green pin, which gives me flexibility in choosing the right option for my needs. And for those who want to minimize vibrations, the HD versions have a harmonic dampener built into the mounting bracket.

Although the Axcel Accutouch HD Sight AV-31 has been an excellent addition to my archery gear, there are a few minor cons to consider.

One downside that has stuck out is the lack of protection for the pin fibers. As a hunter, I worry about how long they'll last under extended use and harsh conditions. Additionally, there seem to be an abundance of screws, which raises concern about potential loose screws over time.
