### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

### [Custom Comfort Flex Holster for S&W M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-comfort-flex-custom-holster-iwb-sw-mp-shield-brwn-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield. This holster is designed to be worn inside the waistband, providing both concealment and comfort. It's been a game-changer for me in terms of carrying my firearm discreetly and comfortably.

The highlight of this holster for me is the custom molded polymer front. It's specifically shaped to fit my weapon perfectly, ensuring a secure fit and easy draw. Another standout feature is the closed-cell foam padding that keeps the weapon away from my body, preventing any discomfort or sweat buildup.

However, one downside I've noticed is that the holster tends to scratch the slide of my gun. It's not a deal breaker, but it's worth mentioning for those who might be concerned about maintaining the condition of their firearms.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the VersaCarry Comfort Flex Custom IWB holster. It provides excellent concealment and comfort, making it a great choice for anyone looking to carry their firearm discreetly and securely.

### [Alien Gear ShapeShift Modular Holster System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-glock-20/public"/></a></div>

The Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is my go-to accessory for my 1911 5" Government. This modular system is perfect for those who like to switch things up and try different carry positions throughout the day. With just a few quick adjustments, I can easily transform the ShapeShift from an IWB holster for casual outings to an OWB paddle holster for more active pursuits.

However, I did encounter some issues with the bulkiness of the holster, especially when using the OWB setup. It's clear that this product is designed with professionals like security personnel or police officers in mind. Additionally, the thumb release on the holster can be difficult to push down and seems a bit wobbly when engaged.

On the positive side, though, the Alien Gear ShapeShift is made in the USA, which is a strong selling point for those who prefer American-made products. And let's not forget the bonus Holster Mount that comes with the Core Carry Pack â€“ it's incredibly versatile and makes it easy to secure my ShapeShift to a variety of surfaces.

In conclusion, while the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack offers a lot of flexibility in terms of carrying positions, it may not be the most comfortable or practical option for everyone. If you're open to trying out various carrying styles and are okay with a slightly bulky design, this product might be worth considering. But if you prioritize comfort and convenience above all else, it might be best to keep looking.

### [Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="leapers-utg-law-enforcement-reversible-shoulder-holster-blk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leapers-utg-law-enforcement-reversible-shoulder-holster-blk-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster, I was instantly impressed by its quality and versatility. This bad boy is perfect for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable way to carry their sidearm.

One thing I really appreciated about this holster is its universal fit. Whether you've got a compact little number or a full-sized beast, this baby can handle it. Plus, with the adjustable design, it fits most body types comfortably.

The padded shoulder harness? Oh man, it's like wearing a cloud. You won't even notice it's there during those long days on the range. The buckle system is super easy to use and allows you to swap around the holster and magazine pouch depending on your dominant hand.

And speaking of the magazine pouch, the inverted design really helps with those lightning-fast reloads. I've honestly never seen anything like it before. The reinforced stitching and seams also give me peace of mind knowing that this holster is built to last, even in the toughest conditions.

However, there is one downside â€“ the vertical belt straps can be a bit cumbersome at times. They do help keep things secure during movement, but they can take some getting used to.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Leapers UTG Law Enforcement Reversible Shoulder Holster for anyone in need of a solid, comfortable, and versatile airsoft gun holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-shapeshift-holster-d-core-carry-pack-1911-5-government-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack for my 1911 5" Government, and let me tell you, it's been quite an experience. I've always been a fan of products made in the USA, so that was a big plus for me. What really impressed me was how easily I could transform this holster into different carrying positions: IWB, appendix carry, OWB belt slide, and OWB paddle. It's like having four holsters in one!

The inclusion of the Holster Mount is a game-changer as well. It allows me to attach my ShapeShift to various surfaces in no time. However, there are a couple of cons to this otherwise impressive product. The first would be the bulkiness, especially when using the OWB setup. I find it too cumbersome for everyday carry, especially for those who aren't in a profession that requires it.

Another issue some users might face is the thumb release on the holster. It seems a bit wobbly and hard to push down when you need to use it. Despite these minor drawbacks, I still think the Alien Gear ShapeShift Holster D Core Carry Pack is a solid choice for those looking for a versatile and modular holster for their 1911 5" Government.

### [Rough Rider Optics Compatible OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-vc-rough-rider-owb-rh-optics-compatible-sub-comp-brown-1/public"/></a></div>

As a first time holster user, I have been thoroughly impressed with the Versacarry Rough Rider Holster. This holster stands out for its comfort and support due to the double ply backing. Its forward cant design ensures minimal print, and the leather is vegetable tanned, giving it an authentic look while maintaining durability.

It's been a breeze adjusting this holster to my Glock 42, and it's compatible with optics, allowing for flexibility depending on my firearm needs. The bonded nylon thread not only adds to its robustness but also enhances its overall appearance. The fit is snug, providing not just concealment but also ensuring no unnecessary shifts as I go about my day.

On the downside, it doesn't cater to left-handed shooters. In addition, it took a while to break in the leather, but it's a small trade-off for the comfort and functionality this holster provides. Overall, it's definitely a product worth considering especially if you're in the market for a reliable and practical holster.

### [Comfortable and Retention Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-off-duty-and-concealment-pro-pak-nylon-horizontal-shoulder-holster-size-1-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on Uncle Mike's Off-Duty and Concealment Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster. As someone who's always on the lookout for versatile and comfortable carry options, I was excited to give this one a try.

The Pro-Pak holster is designed to be simple, lightweight, and super tough. It definitely lives up to those claims. The nylon material feels sturdy yet comfortable against the skin, making it an excellent choice for use under jackets.

One of my favorite features of the Pro-Pak is its horizontal carry design. This allows for a fast draw when needed but also ensures that the holster lies flat against your body.

However, there were some drawbacks to this product as well. The offside tie-down feature can be a little cumbersome, especially when putting on or adjusting the holster. Additionally, some users reported issues with the holster's retention capabilities, leading to concerns about unintended movement during draw or re-holstering.

Despite these minor inconveniences, I still find the Uncle Mike's Pro-Pak Nylon Horizontal Shoulder Holster to be a solid option for those in the market for a shoulder holster. Just keep in mind that it might not be the perfect fit for everyone, so it's always important to do your research and consider your individual needs and preferences before making a purchase.

### [Guardian Arc Angel OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

As a reviewer, I've been using the Versacarry Guardian Arc Angel Outside The Waistband Holster (Size 3) in my daily life and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The combination of distressed brown and black water buffalo leather not only looks stylish but also feels incredibly comfortable against my body. The double-ply raised backing with Flex Vent Technology ensures easy adjustments and a nice grip, making it a pleasure to wear all day long.

One thing that really stands out about this holster is its expedited break-in process. Unlike other holsters that take ages to feel comfortable, this one is ready to go right out of the box. And did I mention how lightweight and compact it is? I can easily conceal it under my clothes without anyone noticing.

In terms of cons, there are none that come to mind immediately. Perhaps some might find the price a bit on the steep side, but considering the quality and durability of this holster, I believe it's worth every penny.

### [Versacarry Trooper Adjustable Thumb Break Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/uncharted-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-trooper-holster-owb-thumb-break-size-2-grey-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-trooper-holster-owb-thumb-break-size-2-grey-black-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Versacarry Trooper Holster for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been quite a journey. The first thing that caught my eye about this product is its unique design - it's crafted with vegetable-tanned water buffalo leather, which not only gives it a sophisticated look but also ensures durability.

One feature that I absolutely love about this holster is its quick release thumb break. It makes drawing my weapon feel almost instinctive, and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my weapon is securely held in place when I'm not using it. However, there is a downside to this as well. The holster is initially quite tight, making it challenging to draw the weapon. Thankfully, I found a solution to this - using mink oil to soften the leather slightly.

Another highlight of this holster is its forward cant. This design allows me to access my weapon more quickly and efficiently than traditional holsters. Additionally, the adjustable retention strap ensures that my weapon stays securely in place, even during intense physical activities.

However, one thing to note is that this holster is not ambidextrous, meaning it's designed for right-handed users only. While this might not be an issue for many users, it could be a limitation for some.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Versacarry Trooper Holster. Its combination of comfort, durability, and functionality makes it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish holster.
