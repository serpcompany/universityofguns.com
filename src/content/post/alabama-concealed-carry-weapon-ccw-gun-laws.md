## Alabama: Gun Laws Summary

Alabama is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, issued at the county level by the local sheriff's office. Any person who is at least 19 years old and legally entitled to possess a firearm can open carry without a permit. On January 1, 2023, Alabama will become a constitutional carry state, allowing any law-abiding resident or citizen who is at least 19 years old to carry a concealed pistol without a permit (Alabama Legislature). Concealed carry is also legal for residents with an Alabama Pistol Permit and for non-residents with a permit from a state that Alabama honors. Alabama honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits (NRA-ILA).

### Self-Defense

Alabama is a Castle Doctrine state, meaning that individuals have no duty to retreat and are allowed to stand their ground, provided they are in a place where they have a right to be and are not engaged in an unlawful activity (NRA-ILA).

#### Civil and Criminal Immunity

A person who uses force, including deadly physical force, as justified and permitted in Alabama law is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force, unless the force was determined to be unlawful (Ala. Code §§ 13A-3-20, 13A-3-23, 13A-3-25 & 13A-3-26).

#### Use of Force in Defense of Self or Another

Alabama law allows a person to use physical force to defend themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by that other person, and they may use a degree of force which they reasonably believe to be necessary for the purpose. The law also allows a person to use deadly force in several circumstances, including when a person reasonably believes that another is about to use unlawful deadly force, or when another attempts to forcibly or unlawfully enter their dwelling, residence, business property or occupied vehicle (Ala. Code §§ 13A-3-23, 13A-3-25 & 13A-3-26).

#### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person in lawful possession or control of premises or a person who is licensed or privileged to be there may use physical force when and to the extent that they reasonably believe it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by the other person. A person may use deadly physical force in defense of property only when the person reasonably believes it necessary to prevent the commission of arson in the first or second degree by the trespasser (Ala. Code §§ 13A-3-23, 13A-3-25 & 13A-3-26).

#### Use of Force in Defense of Property Other than Premises

A person is justified in using physical force, other than deadly physical force, upon another person when and to the extent that they reasonably believe it to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission by the other person of theft or criminal mischief with respect to property other than premises (Ala. Code §§ 13A-3-23, 13A-3-25 & 13A-3-26).

| Does Alabama have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances?                                   | Not addressed in state statutes.

Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.                                                                                                                                  |
