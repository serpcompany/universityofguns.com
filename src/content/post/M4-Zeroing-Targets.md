### [IPSC AR500 Steel Target for Shooting Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="caldwell-66-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/caldwell-66-ipsc-ar500-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this range target for practice and training at my backyard range, and I'm thoroughly impressed by its performance so far. The 3/8-inch thick AR500 hardened steel has withstood several shooting sessions using various calibers without any issue, making it a durable and long-lasting investment.

One of the best things about this target is its large size and bright yellow color, which makes it easily visible from a distance. The sound of bullets hitting the steel target is satisfying, and hearing the "ding" when you hit the bullseye adds to the fun experience. Additionally, I appreciate that it comes with three mounting holes for hanging – setup is super easy! The dimensions of 20 inches long by 12 inches wide are perfect for my needs as well.

There have been a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning though - mainly that the paint coating does wear off quickly after several rounds hit the target. However, this doesn't negatively impact its functionality or durability in any way. Overall, if you're looking for a practical shooting target that's both fun and suitable for recreational use or training purposes – give this one a try!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

This I- Bullseye Gong 10" target has become a staple in my outdoor shooting sessions, thanks to the unique challenge and satisfying ring that accompanies hitting the bullseye center target. The yellow zinc plating not only keeps it rust-free but also ensures easy maintenance with just a simple paint touch-up when needed.

The setup process is made simple and quick with the included chains and T-post mounts, while the high-quality build ensures durability through hundreds of rounds without any issues. Despite testing it in various weather conditions, this spinning target has held up remarkably well over time.

Performance-wise, this 10" Bullseye Gong shines as it consistently rings true when hit accurately by different types of firearms and ammunition. However, I found that during windy days, the gong could be slightly harder to hit due to its movement caused by the wind. Nevertheless, it still provides an enjoyable shooting experience and proves to be an excellent value for money. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun spin on their outdoor shooting sessions!

### [NRA B16 Slow Fire Pistol Target 40722](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/m4-zeroing-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-targets-nra-b16-40723" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-targets-nra-b16-40723/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Champion Traps and Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire target for my home practice sessions, and it has been an excellent addition to my range kit. This target, measuring 10.5" x 12", is the perfect size for practicing trigger squeeze and sight alignment with various firearms. As it is an official NRA target, I feel confident that I am improving my skills with a standardized, high-quality tool.

The available models include competition, silhouette, police pistol, training, and qualification targets, making it suitable for both hobbyist shooters and professionals alike. As a beginner, I have found the training targets particularly useful, as they range from practice to advanced qualification levels.

One of the highlights of this target is its 7-8-9-10 rings black design, which has made my experience at the range more enjoyable and engaging compared to splatter targets or those with lower visibility markings. Additionally, this target closely approximates average slow fire scores at 50 yards, making it an excellent choice for practicing with a variety of firearms.

However, there are a few areas where I feel the target could be improved. The stiff cardstock paper used for the target can become difficult to handle when outside in harsh weather conditions, leading to potential damage and reduced lifespan. Additionally, while the target itself is high-quality, the price may be somewhat discouraging for those on a tighter budget.

In conclusion, the Champion Traps and Targets B16 25 Yd Pistol Slow Fire target is an effective tool for improving your firing accuracy and honing your skills during practice sessions. Despite some minor drawbacks, this product has been a valuable addition to my collection of targets and will continue to serve me well as I progress in my shooting journey.

Imagine, you're standing on the range late afternoon, the sun's down low casting long, slanting shadows, and the wind's blowing, it’s a perfect day for shooting. But alas, your targets are suffering in this weather, the ink fading, and the paper weakening by the minute. No problem, you've got the Rite in the Rain Zeroing Targets. These all-weather targets are a godsend, they won't let you down, no matter the wind, the rain, or the snow. The card stock is weatherproof, offering clean exit holes for easy evaluation, and doesn't warp or shrink despite the elements.

One of the highlights that stood out for me was the MIL Grid. It's true MIL and it's so helpful for adjusting your optics and systems. Sighting has never been easier! Plus, the permanent target imprint won't wear off or rub off, even when wet. The sheets separate easily, so even if they get damp from precipitation or dew, it's quick to have them set up again.

However, one downside I found was the sheet's rigidity when wet. They do flop and droop when damp, but as long as they dry out completely, they regain their rigidity.

You don't want to miss out on this opportunity to upgrade your game as a shooter.
