### [Ultra-Bright Fiber Optic Sight for Accurate Shots in Low Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="truglo-tsx-pro-5-pin-019-sight-black-w-light-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-tsx-pro-5-pin-019-sight-black-w-light-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the TruGlo TSX Pro Series Standard Sight and I've been using it extensively for the past few weeks. This sight is based on the award-winning TRU-SITE XTREME Series design, making it an ultrastrong and lightweight option for any archer. The stainless steel tube helps illuminate the pins, while the ultra-fine click adjustment allows for precise windage and elevation adjustments. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the Tru-Touch soft-feel technical coating, which ensures silence and extra durability during use. Additionally, the glow-in-the-dark shooters ring, luminescent tape at the level, and adjustable rheostat light deliver glare-free, eye-to-pin focus in any condition. The adjustable second- and third-axis level with two vertical bars further enhances accuracy and ensures a consistent shooting experience. 

Another notable feature is the reversible bracket, offering greater vertical adjustability as needed. The aperture has a 2-inch inner diameter with. 019-inch pins, making it suitable for right- or left-handed bows. The black finish adds a sleek touch to the overall design. 

However, there are some cons that I've encountered while using this sight. Firstly, the light isn't as bright as expected, especially in low-light conditions. Additionally, the pins can be quite challenging to align properly at times. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with the TruGlo TSX Pro Series Standard Sight. It offers various useful features and is a great option for those looking to improve their accuracy and overall shooting experience. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as the not-so-bright light and finicky pin alignment, I believe that these can be easily overlooked given the sight's many benefits and competitive price point. 


### [Truglo AC Range Rover Black Sight with Infinite Brightness Settings](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="truglo-ac-range-rover-019-black-sight-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truglo-ac-range-rover-019-black-sight-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Truglo AC Range Rover. 019 Black Sight, and it's been a game-changer for my target shooting experience. The first thing that struck me was how easy it was to set up. The tool-less yardage lock and smooth bracket movement made it incredibly user-friendly, even for someone like me who's not particularly tech-savvy. 

One of the standout features of this sight is its adjustable rheostat, which allows for infinite brightness settings. This was a lifesaver when I found myself in low-light shooting scenarios, ensuring that I always had a clear view of my target. In addition, the replaceable batteries ensure that I can keep shooting without having to worry about running out of power mid-session. 

However, there are a few minor cons to consider. Some users reported issues with the screws provided, as they were quite brittle and prone to breaking. Additionally, a few left-handed users found it difficult to adjust the sight to their needs, as the mounting holes are only beveled on one side. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall experience with the Truglo AC Range Rover. 019 Black Sight has been overwhelmingly positive. Its durability, ease of use, and adaptability make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their target shooting skills. 


### [Accu-Stat II 5 Pin Sight with Independent Axis Adjustments](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axcel-landslyde-picatinny-sight-black-av-41-1-pin-010-green-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-landslyde-picatinny-sight-black-av-41-1-pin-010-green-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Axcel Landslyde Picatinny Sight for a few months now, and I must say, it's become one of my go-to options for enhancing my archery experience. The first thing that caught my attention was its sleek, black design. It looks good and feels solid in my hands. 

One feature that really stood out for me is the slider sight with a rapid adjust knob and quick release. This makes adjusting yardage settings so much easier and quicker than other sights I've used. Plus, it's whisper quiet, which is always a bonus when you're trying to be stealthy in the wild. 

Another highlight is the adjustable dead stop. This allows me to quickly access specific yardage settings without having to fumble around with adjustments while I'm out hunting. It's a time-saver and definitely a pro in my book. 

However, there's one con that I've noticed. The CCT technology aiming ring at the same depth as sight pins can be a bit tricky to get used to, especially if you're new to this type of archery sight. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. 

All in all, the Axcel Landslyde Picatinny Sight has definitely improved my archery game. Its unique features make it stand out from other sights on the market, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to up their game. 


### [Axion Soul Hunter 5 Pin Sight .019" Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm\_source=universityofguns&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axion-soul-hunter-5-pin-sight-019-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axion-soul-hunter-5-pin-sight-019-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's tried out many sights for my Springfield 1911, I can attest to the Axion Soul Hunter being a game changer. Its lightweight design at just 6 oz makes it incredibly comfortable to use, and its all CNC machined build lends it a solid feel. The laser-etched adjustment lines are a nifty feature, making setup and windage adjustments a breeze. 

One of my favorite aspects was the 2" pin guard with its easy-to-see Glo-ring. It significantly improved my target sighting in low light conditions, which was truly a life-saver during my late-night hunting sessions. 

The Soul Hunter's staggered mounting holes took adaptability to another level, fitting my left-handed preference as smoothly as it would for a right-hand shooter. The included rheostat blue sight light and level didn't hurt either, offering that extra touch of precision. 

Admittedly, there were a few minor drawbacks. The adjustment knobs could be a tad smoother, and the pins felt slightly stiffer than what I'm accustomed to. However, the benefits vastly outweighed these minor annoyances for me. In conclusion, while the Axion Soul Hunter comes with its own set of quirks, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, compact sight for their Springfield 1911.

I recently came across the Truglo AC-4 Range Rover Sight, and it's quickly become my go-to bow sight. Why, you ask? . Well, unlike traditional bow sights, the AC-4 can be locked in place as a multi-pin sight, or easily dialed in to whatever distance I'm shooting. 

It's like having two sights in one! . Plus, the pre-printed yardage tapes are super easy to calibrate, whether you're using the top pin or the bottom one. And the best part? . 

There's a whopping 60+ pre-printed yardage tapes included, so I can use it with pretty much any bow and arrow combo out there.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/trijicon-sights-for-springfield-1911?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axcel-accutouch-picatinny-sight-black-accustat-ii-3-pin-019-rh-lh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-accutouch-picatinny-sight-black-accustat-ii-3-pin-019-rh-lh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Axcel Accutouch Picatinny Sight Black / Accustat II 3 Pin for the past few weeks, and I must say, it has completely revolutionized my archery experience. The adjustable red elevation tension lever is perfect for customizing how easily the sight slides along the elevation bar, giving me full control over my aim. 

One of the features that really stood out to me is the Accu-Click system, allowing me to set each pin at specific distances so I can quickly adjust my sight without fumbling with knobs. The in-line sight level also ensures that my bow stays perfectly level, which has drastically improved my accuracy. 

However, there's one minor downside to this otherwise fantastic product. The CCT aiming ring, while designed for greater accuracy when viewed off-center, can be slightly difficult to see in low light conditions. Despite this, it doesn't take away from the overall performance of the Accutouch Picatinny Sight. 

In summary, this sight has significantly enhanced my archery experience, making it easier for me to quickly and accurately adjust my sight and maintain a level shooting platform. While there might be some minor inconveniences in certain lighting conditions, they are more than outweighed by the benefits of this high-quality product.
