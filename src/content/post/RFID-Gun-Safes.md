### [RFID Gun Safe with Digital Clock and USB Charging Ports](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-night-guard-rfid-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard as my go-to bedside firearm safe for several months now, and it has consistently impressed me. The RFID technology is incredibly convenient and provides quick and hands-free access to my handgun, even in low light conditions. I really appreciate the stealthy operation of the spring-assisted drawer, which is super quiet when opened during nighttime use.

The build quality is excellent, with a heavy-duty exterior housing that meets strict industry standards for firearm storage. The hardened interior locking lugs add an extra layer of protection and peace of mind. Additionally, I love the unique features like the digital clock display and USB charging ports for electronic devices - these not only make life easier but also add to the overall value of this safe.

There are minor drawbacks to consider, such as some users reporting accuracy issues with the clock, but this hasn't been a significant concern in my experience. Programming multiple RFID tags may be time-consuming initially, but it ultimately enhances convenience and flexibility when accessing the safe.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and secure bedside gun safe with innovative hands-free technology and added functionality like charging ports and an included security cable. With its strong construction and thoughtful design features, the Hornady RAPiD Safe Night Guard truly stands out among its competitors in terms of both style and substance.

### [10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet with Ample Storage and Anti-Pick Lock System](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/union-safe-company-10-gun-key-lock-security-cabinet-1/public"/></a></div>

The UNION SAFE COMPANY fully welded 10 Gun Key Lock Security Cabinet is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for an affordable and hassle-free gun storage solution. The delivery and assembly process were both smooth and efficient, with the cabinet arriving in perfect condition and being easy to set up.

One of this cabinet's standout features is its double-bit three point key lock system, which ensures that only authorized personnel can access the firearms stored inside. Additionally, the pry-resistant concealed hinges provide an extra layer of security against tampering attempts. Despite being made from thinner pressed steel, this safe has proven to be strong and durable in keeping my firearms safe from harm.

In terms of storage capacity, there's a generous 6. 98 cu. ft. , providing ample room for rifles, shotguns, handguns, and supplies. However, one area that could be improved is the inclusion of shelves within the cabinet to better organize smaller items like ammunition or gun accessories.

While not suitable for advanced protection requirements such as fire or water resistance or high-security digital locks, it serves as an effective basic security solution for keeping guns away from children's reach while offering some level of security against unauthorized access by using a key lock system with multiple pins to deter easy picking. Overall, I would recommend this product based on its affordability and ease of use without compromising on basic safety features like the key lock system and concealed hinges design which make it a great value purchase for those needing secure gun storage at home without breaking their budget!

### [Vaultek RS500i WiFi Biometric Smart Rifle Safe with Quick-Access Spring Door](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-rs500i-wifi-biometric-smart-rifle-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

After using the Vaultek RS500i Biometric Gun Safe, I was highly impressed with its sturdy construction and advanced features. The steel casing provided excellent protection for my firearms while the pre-drilled mounting holes allowed me to securely install the safe where I needed it. The biometric scanner is quick and accurate, allowing for fast access when needed. Additionally, the modular design gave me the flexibility to arrange the interior according to my specific needs.

The highlights of this safe include a spring-loaded AR mount that enables quick and easy access to your rifle by automatically opening when access is granted. The 4-slot AR mag rack provides additional storage for your ammunition, while the extra barrel mount and barrel mount adapter offer further customization options to suit your specific needs. The single pistol/AR mag holster ensures secure storage of other weapons or additional magazines, and the 2-slot pistol mag rack allows efficient organization of handgun ammo within the safe.

The only con I experienced was that sometimes door bolts would not fully retract after opening - although this issue was sporadic and did not deter from my overall satisfaction with this product. Overall, the Vaultek RS500i Biometric Gun Safe offers high-quality construction, advanced features, reliable protection for your firearms at an affordable price point!

### [Biometric Gun Safe with Silent Access and Interior Lighting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sentrysafe-qap1blx-quick-access-biometric-pistol-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

The 1-Gun Biometric Gun Safe with Interior Lighting by SentrySafe is a compact and elegant solution for your home defense needs. The biometric fingerprint scanner allows for quick access to your firearm, while the gas strut ensures that the door opens quietly and effortlessly. The interior lighting is a useful feature that enables easy retrieval of your weapon in low-light conditions.

This gun safe also offers backup entry options through a digital keypad and override key, providing added security. However, some users have reported inconsistencies in the biometric sensor's performance, which may not be reliable in emergency situations. Additionally, there have been complaints about rechargeable batteries not working with this product, which can be inconvenient for those who prefer using them over alkaline batteries.

Despite these minor setbacks, overall I found this gun safe to be sturdy and well-made, offering advanced protection for my home defense needs. With dimensions of 12. 1 in W x 9. 9 in D x 3. 2 in H (interior: 9. 7 in W x 6. 7 in D x 2. 2 in H) and weighing only 12 pounds, it is easy to install and doesn't take up much space.

### [RFID-Activated Enclosed Gunlocker for Tactical Rifles and Shotguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hornady-rapid-safe-ar-gunlocker-rfid-1/public"/></a></div>

The Hornady Rapid Safe AR Gunlocker is a reliable and secure choice for gun storage, providing quick access via RFID devices and a digital keypad. It's made of thick 16 gauge steel with four internal hardened locking lugs, which exceeds ASTM safety standards. The interior has enough space to store up to two tactical rifles or shotguns, accommodating standard optical sights and 30-round magazines.

One downside is that it may not be able to fit rifles with larger scopes due to limited depth clearance when extracting weapons. Additionally, having a hole in the back for running power cords can potentially compromise security, though some may view this as a necessary trade-off for easy setup convenience. Overall, the Hornady Rapid Safe AR Gunlocker offers solid protection and ease of use, making it an excellent storage solution for those seeking fast access to their firearms.

### [Liberty Centurion 12-Gun Safe: Fireproof Protection for Your Valuables](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="liberty-safe-centurion-12-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-centurion-12-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

As a proud owner of the Liberty Centurion Safe, let me share my experience with this product. When I was searching for a safe that could store my valuable possessions securely and provide adequate protection from fire, I came across this model. After doing some research and comparison shopping, I decided to invest in it.

And let me tell you - it has not disappointed! Not only is it well-constructed, but its Palusol heat-activated door seal provides an added layer of security against smoke and heat up to 1200 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes - making sure everything stored inside remains protected in case of an emergency. What's more, the single hardened steel plate adds another level of defense against drill attempts while the locking bars prevent pry attacks. Additionally, the SecuRam toplit electronic lock and factory-installed door storage panel make accessing your valuables both convenient and secure.

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks that are worth mentioning: despite being advertised as a '12 gun capacity' safe, fitting more than 5 or 6 rifles/shotguns can be challenging due to the limited floor space allotted in the interior compartment. Also, while it does offer reliable security features at an affordable price point (compared to larger safes), one should keep in mind that it comes with Liberty's lowest rating for security and fire protection among their safes – so do manage your expectations accordingly! But overall if you have limited space or are looking for something relatively smaller yet efficient at protecting your belongings then this safe certainly won't let you down!

### [Portable Pistol Safe with Impact Protection and One-Touch Locking](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vaultek-lifepod-covert-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-lifepod-covert-black-1/public"/></a></div>

After personally reviewing the Vaultek LifePod Pistol and Personal Safes, I can confidently say that this slim and stylish safe has quite a few unique features to boast about. Its robust exterior is made from a proprietary material blend engineered by Vaultek, ensuring excellent protection for your valuables. One can easily set up the safe with just a single touch on its backlit LED keypad which is both well-made and user-friendly. The keypad feature also includes an option to disable the interior keyway in case you need extra security measures.

This personal safe doesn't claim to offer maximum security or long-term storage solutions but it's certainly ideal as an on-the-go companion for your valuables. It's airline regulation compliant making it perfect for travelers who need secure storage while on transit. The safe can accommodate one pistol comfortably and comes with adjustable shelves for added organization options. Although there are certain limitations like no Bluetooth or WiFi compatibility, overall, I would highly recommend the Vaultek LifePod Pistol and Personal Safes because of its sleek design, ease of use, and secure traveling features.

### [Portable TSA Compliant Weather Resistant Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rfid-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vaultek-lifepod-portable-weather-resistant-tsa-compliant-safe-covert-black-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I had the opportunity to use the Vaultek LifePod safe for a few weeks and it caught my attention due to its exceptional design and durability. The exterior is rugged and the dual side compression latches combined with an interior rubber gasket provide great protection from elements. Additionally, the lockable mechanism is easy to operate and provides extra security with its key bypass feature. It's also waterproof and floats when loaded up to 2 pounds of weight!

During my experience with it, I found it extremely convenient while traveling with my handgun. The small yet secure compartment allowed me to safely store my weapon in my car without worrying about someone breaking it open or cutting off the cable tethered to it. The battery life was impressive as well; it lasted me a couple of months on a single 9V battery before requiring replacement.

One thing I noticed was that the keypad could be a little sensitive at times - entering the code sometimes resulted in entering incorrect numbers accidentally which caused some frustration. However, considering all other features and benefits provided by this compact safe, this minor inconvenience can be overlooked.

Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase of the Vaultek LifePod safe and would definitely recommend it for those who are looking for a durable and secure portable storage solution for their firearms or valuables while traveling or on outdoor adventures.

### Are RFID gun safes more expensive than traditional ones?

RFID gun safes can be more expensive than traditional safes, primarily due to the cost of the RFID technology. However, they may offer additional features or greater security, making them a worthwhile investment for many gun owners.

### How secure are RFID gun safes against theft?

RFID gun safes offer a high level of security against theft. The RFID technology prevents unauthorized access, and many models also include reinforced steel construction and other anti-theft features, such as hidden hinges and re-locking mechanisms.

### How can I ensure that my RFID tag or bracelet is secure?

To ensure the security of your RFID tag or bracelet, never store it near your safe or in a location where it can easily be found or stolen. Instead, keep it on your person, inside a wallet or bag, or in a secure location away from the safe when not in use. This will help protect against unauthorized access to your firearms. </p)
