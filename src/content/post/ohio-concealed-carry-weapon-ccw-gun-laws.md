Ohio: Gun Laws Summary
----------------------


Ohio is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level by a county sheriff. There is no permit, background check or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. Open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit. Individuals 21 years old or older not prohibited from carrying or possessing a handgun are no longer required to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun as of June 12, 2022. Since open carry is not addressed in state statutes, the Federal minimum age for possession of a handgun of 18 years old applies. Disclaimer: Carrying in vehicles is not addressed in the Constitutional Carry bill. According to the Ohio Attorney General, it is legal to possess a loaded firearm in a vehicle. Residents can still obtain a CHL. They must have completed eight hours of firearms training and meet other criteria to qualify. Current and former servicemen and women are able to obtain an Ohio CHL without paying the fee or going through a concealed carry class. In addition, active duty military with a valid military identification card and documentation of successful firearms training that meets or exceeds that required in Ohio do not need to obtain an Ohio license. Non-residents can obtain a CHL if they work in Ohio. In terms of reciprocity, Ohio will honor permits issued by any state or jurisdiction.


### Immunity from Civil Liability


Ohio’s self defense laws presume that a person has acted in defense of another or self-defense when applying deadly force if that person is in a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be. Therefore, the prosecution would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another or defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be. [[Ohio Rev. Code §2901.09](https://codes.findlaw.com/oh/title-xxix-crimes-procedure/oh-rev-code-sect-2901-09.html), [§2901.05](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2901.05)]


#### Self-Defense


Ohio adheres to the Castle Doctrine and based on the Governor’s signing of SB 175 on January 4, 2021, is now a “stand your ground” state. There is no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence provided the person is in a place that the person has the lawful right to be. You must have a real belief that you were in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm and that the use of deadly force was the only way to escape the danger. Deadly force may only be used to protect against serious bodily harm or death. [[SB 175](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA133-SB-175)]
