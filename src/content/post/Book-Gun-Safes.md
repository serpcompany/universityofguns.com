### [High-Capacity 5 Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/book-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/5-gun-safe-american-furniture-classics-1/public"/></a></div>

Man, I've been using this 5 Gun Safe from American Furniture Classics for quite some time now. I've got to say, it's been a real game-changer in securing my firearms. The 3-directional bolt system along with the soft foam pad at the bottom has proved to be a real lifesaver when it comes to keeping my valuables safely stowed away.

One of the standout features for me has been the high strength steel construction. This thing is an absolute beast, providing me with an unmatched level of security. It's also got holes for mounting to the wall and floor, which gives me peace of mind knowing that it's going nowhere.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The keyed access can be a bit of a pain at times, especially when you're in a hurry. And while the high-strength steel is fantastic, the thing is quite heavy, making it a bit of a challenge to move around.

Overall, I've been quite happy with my purchase. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly done a great job of keeping my firearms safe and secure. So if you're in the market for a gun safe, this one's definitely worth considering.

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet in black, and I have to say, it's been a game changer for me. I had been looking for a safe and secure way to store my long guns and handguns, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy, high-end safe. That's where this little cabinet came in.

The first thing that caught my eye was the two separate compartments. I could fit five long guns in the bottom compartment and have a separate section for my handguns and ammunition up top. The three-point locking system gave me an added sense of security, knowing that my firearms were protected against unauthorized access.

Once I got the cabinet home and assembled, I was impressed with the quality of the materials. The powder-coated steel was sturdy, and the soft foam barrel rest and carpeted floor added an extra layer of protection for my guns. I also appreciated the fact that the cabinet came fully assembled, so all I had to do was mount it to the wall – no complicated assembly required.

However, there were a few downsides to this cabinet as well. The main issue was that it wasn't very heavy or sturdy, which made me worry that a determined thief might be able to carry it away if they gained access to my home. Additionally, I noticed that the paint chipped off in a few spots, which was a little disappointing considering the quality of the materials.

Overall, I would highly recommend the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Metal Security Cabinet to anyone looking for a secure and affordable way to store their firearms. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done and provides peace of mind, knowing that my guns are safe and protected.

However, it's worth mentioning that setting up the interior padding could be slightly improved.
