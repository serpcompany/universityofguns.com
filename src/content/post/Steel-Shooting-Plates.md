### [1/4 inch AR500 Bullseye Shooting Target for Rifles and Pistols - 10" Gong with Yellow Zinc Plating for Enhanced Durability and Spall Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1-4-inch-ar500-bullseye-shooting-target-for-shooting-rifles-by-shootingtargets7-size-1-4-ar500-steel-1/public"/></a></div>

This I- Bullseye Gong 10" target has become a staple in my outdoor shooting sessions, thanks to the unique challenge and satisfying ring that accompanies hitting the bullseye center target. The yellow zinc plating not only keeps it rust-free but also ensures easy maintenance with just a simple paint touch-up when needed.

The setup process is made simple and quick with the included chains and T-post mounts, while the high-quality build ensures durability through hundreds of rounds without any issues. Despite testing it in various weather conditions, this spinning target has held up remarkably well over time.

Performance-wise, this 10" Bullseye Gong shines as it consistently rings true when hit accurately by different types of firearms and ammunition. However, I found that during windy days, the gong could be slightly harder to hit due to its movement caused by the wind. Nevertheless, it still provides an enjoyable shooting experience and proves to be an excellent value for money. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun spin on their outdoor shooting sessions!

### [Affordable Indoor Shooting Practice with Steel Tyme Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="laserlyte-steel-tyme-target-2-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/laserlyte-steel-tyme-target-2-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

The Steel Tyme Target by Crimson Trace is a versatile tool for improving shooting skills at all levels, from beginners to experienced marksmen. I've been using it for a few weeks and find its indoor/outdoor capability and portability very convenient - no need to drive out to the range! Setup is quick and easy with included AAA batteries.

I appreciate that this target can be used on any flat surface or hung on the wall, which enables my son and me to practice fast shots, precise shots, and track groups without leaving our home. The sound of hitting steel gives instant feedback accompanied by flashing LED lights, making it an engaging training experience.

The durability of the product after extended use seems great; though I've only had it for a couple of weeks, the virtual target has held up well against hundreds of shots without needing replacement – just battery changes are required occasionally. The size of the round target provides an adequate challenge while still being large enough not to be frustratingly difficult to hit consistently.

Overall, I highly recommend this target as it has exceeded my expectations in helping me hone my shooting abilities while saving time and money on trips to the range and ammunition costs! My only caution is that some users may experience difficulty muting the sound initially; however, once figured out, it works as advertised.

### [.22 Dialed Spinner Steel Target for Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/22-dialed-spinner-shooting-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this fun steel spinner target for a while now, and I can't tell you how much enjoyment it's brought to my shooting sessions. It's definitely not your average paper target. The innovative design allows me to switch up my aiming points, keeping things interesting and challenging. The sturdy construction ensures that the target stays put even when I'm firing away with my. 22.

Being a bit smaller than I'd prefer at 7.5 inches, I wish it was a bit bigger. Nevertheless, it has been a fantastic addition to my shooting sessions. It's made out of 1/4 inch steel, which means it's durable and able to handle the power of a. 22 rim fire and even a higher caliber if that's your preference. As I continue to use it and observe its performance, I'll be sure to update my review accordingly. Overall, this is a unique and engaging target that adds a new level of excitement to shooting practice.

### [Durable 9.5" Steel Gong Target for Shooting](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sme-9-5-inch-steel-gong-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sme-9-5-inch-steel-gong-1/public"/></a></div>

The SME 9.5" Gong Target is a high-quality, sturdy gong designed for shooting enthusiasts. Made of durable NM500 steel, this target can withstand centerfire handguns and rifles, offering a satisfying "ding" sound with each hit. However, the attached stand isn't as strong and has been known to succumb to hits from a variety of ammo types. Therefore, it might be wise to place the gong on a more stable, solid mount. Despite this, the actual gong itself is extremely resilient and provides hours of shooting fun.

From my personal experience, the SME 9.5" Gong Target has shown promising resilience against my. 22 caliber shots. The sound of impact is incredibly satisfying and the target holds up well even after multiple shots. However, the stand can't handle a lot of abuse and tends to go down pretty quickly with larger caliber ammo. This might be an issue for those keen on using higher caliber ammo and not wanting to worry about constantly setting up the target.

In conclusion, the SME 9.5" Gong Target is a decent target for shooting beginners. The steel gong is quite resilient and the sound of impact is satisfying. However, the accompanying stand leaves much to be desired and may let you down if you're consistently firing using higher caliber ammo. Despite this, the target itself is worth the investment and can offer hours of fun shooting practice.

### [Dragon 3/8" AR500 Steel Shooting Target with Square Holes and Non-Glare Paint](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="dragon-targets-dragon-3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dragon-targets-dragon-3-8-ar500-steel-shooting-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Dragon Targets Dragon 3/8" AR500 Steel Shooting Target to sharpen my shooting skills. As soon as I unboxed it, I could tell that this was a high-quality target - made in America with thick AR500 steel. The CNC laser cut design gives it an impressive precision that stands out from other targets I've used.

The non-reflective white paint was a pleasant surprise; it definitely eliminates the glare while maximizing visibility. It's also quite gratifying when the target makes a loud "ding" sound after being hit, giving immediate feedback on my aim.

However, there are a few downsides. Firstly, the lack of included carriage bolts could be a minor inconvenience for some users. Secondly, the paint does require touch-ups before and after use, but this is relatively easy to manage.

Overall, I would recommend the Dragon Targets Dragon 3/8" AR500 Steel Shooting Target to anyone looking for a professional-grade target that offers immediate feedback on your shots.

### [Birchwood Casey .50 Round Steel Target Plate](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-shooting-plates?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-1-2-x-10-nm500-steel-round-target-plate-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-1-2-x-10-nm500-steel-round-target-plate-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently found myself in need of a new shooting target to up my rifle game. I came across the Birchwood Casey 1/2" x 10" NM500 Steel Round Target Plate and decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you, this target has been an absolute game-changer!

The first thing that stood out to me was its size. At just half an inch thick and ten inches in diameter, it's perfect for shooting practice without taking up too much space on my range. The high visibility white powder coat paint also makes it easy to see even when you're aiming from a distance.

One aspect that impressed me most about the Birchwood Casey target is its durability. Despite being fired upon repeatedly with a centerfire rifle or pistol, it continues to deliver that satisfying "clang" sound every time, making every shot feel rewarding. Plus, its compatibility with carriage bolts (though not included) adds another layer of convenience for mounting options.

However, there are some cons worth mentioning. While the target itself is excellent, it does not have a built-in reset mechanism. This means that after each shot, you'll need to manually reset the target by repositioning it or investing in a compatible reset kit.

Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with the Birchwood Casey 1/2" x 10" NM500 Steel Round Target Plate. Its compact size, high visibility paint, and rugged durability make it an exceptional choice for shooters looking to improve their skills. Just remember that resetting the target may require additional effort or investment.
