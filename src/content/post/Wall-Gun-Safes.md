### [Tactical Walls 1242 Top Locking Shelf: A Hidden Gun Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/wall-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="tactical-walls-825-pistol-length-shelf-white-825-0825rfwt-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tactical-walls-825-pistol-length-shelf-white-825-0825rfwt-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Tactical Walls 1242 Top Locking Shelf in my home, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. Not only does it provide ample storage for my firearms and accessories, but it also looks like a sleek piece of furniture that seamlessly blends into my decor. The foam-lined secret compartment is incredibly well-made, and the magnetic keys make accessing my belongings a breeze.

One of the things that stood out to me the most was how easy it was to assemble and install. The instructions were clear, and it only took me about 30 minutes to get everything up and running. The only minor issue I encountered was with the screws used to secure the top brackets, which were a little too long for my liking. Other than that, the build quality is top-notch, and the medium density polyurethane foam insert is incredibly customizable.

In terms of pros, the hidden compartment is definitely the star of the show. It's large enough to store multiple firearms and accessories, and the magnetic locks ensure that everything stays securely in place. Additionally, the fact that it's handcrafted in the United States and made with high-quality materials is a major selling point.

On the downside, the foam insert could use some improvement. While it's easy to customize, it doesn't seem to be the most durable material, and I worry that it may wear out over time. Additionally, the shelf could benefit from some additional organizational features, such as built-in compartments or dividers.

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the Tactical Walls 1242 Top Locking Shelf. It's a stylish and functional addition to any home, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-quality gun storage solution.
