### [Accurate Adjustable 1-Pin Archery Sight for RH/LH Shooters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="axcel-accutouch-plus-carbon-pro-sight-av-41-1-pin-019-rh-lh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-accutouch-plus-carbon-pro-sight-av-41-1-pin-019-rh-lh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Axcel Accutouch Plus Carbon Pro Sight AV-41, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my shooting experience. The Accu-Click system is a standout feature that sets it apart from other sights on the market. It allows me to set "clicks" at specific distances, making it incredibly easy to adjust the sight. The 45-degree facing sight tape also makes it much easier to see where the yardage indicator is set, which is a huge plus.

One of the most convenient aspects of this sight is the ability to make 1st, 2nd, and 3rd axis adjustments without the use of shims. The micro-adjust windage is another great feature, as it can be locked into place until I need to adjust it further. The included Axcel AccuView Scope, with its adjustable rheostat, is also a welcome addition.

On the downside, I have found that when I adjust the sight beyond 70 yards, my arrows don't always clear the bottom of the sight. However, this hasn't been a major issue for me, as I don't typically shoot game at distances beyond that range.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Axcel Accutouch Plus Carbon Pro Sight AV-41. Its adjustability, ease of use, and high-quality construction make it a must-have for any avid shooter. I'm confident that this sight will serve me well for years to come.

Using these sights pens, I started to touch up every single chipped, dull, or scratched spot on my sights. It was like giving them a new lease on life! And don't even get me started on how easy it was - you know, like a parking pen with no mess. Just rub on with the "chisel point" felt tip and voilà!

One thing that stood out was the vividness of these colors. They stood out bold and sharp against any target, which was perfect for all those contrasting sight pictures I love to set up. Plus, this was a package of three, so I didn't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

However, there were a couple of cons that I encountered while using this product. There was the issue of the paint being a little too thin and watery at times. And while I appreciated the included instructions, they felt a bit incomplete and poor. But those minor setbacks weren't enough to deter me from using these sight pens again.

In conclusion, I'd say that the Birchwood Casey - Super Bright Pen Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to bring new life to their old sights.

One Shot, One Dead"

Last month, I decided to upgrade my old compound bow sight to a Spot Hogg Hunter Sight. I'd heard stellar reviews about its quality and performance, so I took the plunge. Boy, am I glad I did!

The MRT (Multi-Ring Technology) pin guard was the first thing that caught my eye. It came with two multi-ring options, ensuring proper peep to sight alignment with most setups. Even in changing lighting conditions, I could always see the bright visible ring, which helped tremendously with my accuracy.

Then there are the bulletproof pins. They completely conceal and protect the fiber, making sure they stay sharp and bright for countless shots. Add in the improved lighting cavity and protected fiber optics, and this sight performs like a dream under any circumstances.

But what truly sets the Spot Hogg Hunter Sight apart is its adjustability. The micro-adjustable pins allow for minute changes, giving me the precision I need to hit my targets consistently. And did I mention, it's hard-mounted? No more worrying about it shifting during intense hunts!

Sure, the setup can be a bit complex, especially with the unique pin adjustment method. But once you get the hang of it, you'll see why so many people rave about this sight. It's not just a bow sight; it's a game-changer!

However, there's one minor drawback - the dovetail mounting system replaced by a fixed plate. It might take some getting used to, but it's worth it for the overall quality and performance of the sight.

All in all, if you're looking for a top-notch, hard-mounted bow sight that offers exceptional adjustability and accuracy, look no further than the Spot Hogg Hunter Sight. Highly recommended!

### [Compact Lightweight Deployable Whitetail Sight](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="black-gold-ascent-whitetail-3-pin-rh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/black-gold-ascent-whitetail-3-pin-rh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Black Gold Ascent Whitetail 3 Pin RH for a while now, and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer for my hunting trips. The first thing that stood out to me is how compact and lightweight it is. When you're in a tree stand or ground blind with limited space, this sight really holds its own.

One of the most impressive features of this sight is the. 019 Micro Groove pins, which provide an incredibly clear aiming point with minimal target obstruction. This makes it incredibly easy to take precise shots, even under pressure.

The high-performance PhotoChromatic shell is another standout feature. It automatically adapts the pin brightness to all light conditions, ensuring perfect pin clarity no matter how bright or dim it is outside. It's like having a built-in pair of glasses for your bow sight!

Another feature that I really appreciate is the Non-Micro adjustable 1st and 2nd Axis. This makes it incredibly easy to dial in the sight for precise bow-to-sight alignment, which is essential for accurate shooting.

The Dial of Death feature is also really useful, letting you instantly dial to pre-determined yardages with a single indicator needle. This means you can quickly and easily adjust your sight for different distances, even in the heat of the moment.

One downside to this sight is that it doesn't come with a lens already installed. While it is compatible with 2X or 4X lenses, you'll need to buy one separately if you want to use it.

Overall, I've been extremely happy with the Black Gold Ascent Whitetail 3 Pin RH. It's a high-quality, compact sight that has made a huge difference in my hunting game. If you're in the market for a new bow sight, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

### [Versatile, Lightweight Tetra Sight with Tritium and Wheel Forward Design](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hha-tetra-10-lh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hha-tetra-10-lh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'm an avid archer who recently discovered the HHA Tetra. 10/LH, and I must say, it has truly enhanced my shooting experience. Its lightweight design packs a solid punch, delivering silky smooth movement on both fixed frame and dovetail bar options.

The Tetra's patented R. D. S. sight tapes provide pinpoint accuracy - perfect for both bowhunting and 3D shootouts. The wheel forward design is quiver friendly, making it a favorite amongst fellow archers. With adjustments for 2nd and 3rd axis, plus a full line of accessories, this sight has undoubtedly made its mark in the world of slider sights.

Another feature that particularly stood out for me was the two-stage windage adjustment. It simplifies sighting in tremendously, eliminating the need for wrenches. Its laser-engraved witness marks and user-friendly adjustment knobs ensure precision even when making minor adjustments in the field.

Also, the mechanical rheostat for fiber optic brightness control is truly ingenious. Coupled with the machined aluminum pin carrier offering excellent fiber protection, this truly stands out as a state-of-the-art product.

However, while the leveling bubble certainly helps with alignment, it could be more visible to ensure quick and accurate adjustments. Nonetheless, the HHA Tetra. 10/LH has truly been a game-changer for me, making my archery sessions even more enjoyable. I couldn't recommend it highly enough.

## FAQ

### What are tritium sights?

Tritium sights are a type of aiming device used on firearms, such as pistols and rifles, that assist in aligning the barrel with the target for accurate shooting in low-light conditions or complete darkness. They contain small amounts of the radioactive isotope tritium, which emits a constant faint glow without the need for an external power source or batteries. This makes them reliable and easy to see in various lighting scenarios.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tritium-Sights-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Tritium-Sights-5"></a></div>

### How do tritium sights work?

Tritium sights work by utilizing phosphor inserts that are filled with tritium gas. When the tritium decays, it releases electrons that cause the phosphor material to glow, creating a visible image in low-light and dark environments. The glowing dots on the sights are the phosphor inserts illuminated by the tritium gas, providing a visible aiming point for the shooter.

### What is the difference between tritium sights and fiber optic sights?

- **Tritium Sights:** Tritium sights require no external power source as they rely on tritium gas, providing a constant faint glow that is visible even in complete darkness.

- **Fiber Optic Sights:** Fiber optic sights require an external light source, such as sunlight or ambient room light, to charge the fibers that amplify the light and make the sights visible. In low-light or no-light scenarios, fiber optic sights may not function well.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/tritium-sights?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tritium-Sights-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Tritium-Sights-6"></a></div>

### How long do tritium sights last?

The average lifespan of tritium is about 12 years, after which the illumination will gradually decrease. Manufacturers may offer service kits or exchange programs to replace the tritium inserts with new ones that will continue to provide visibility in low-light and dark environments.

### How do I install tritium sights on my firearm?

To install tritium sights on your firearm, you will need a sight pusher tool or a firearm sight installation kit. Detailed instructions can vary depending on the specific weapon model and tritium sight type, so it is recommended to consult the user manual or instructions that come with the product. If you are not comfortable performing the installation yourself, a professional gunsmith can assist you.

### Are tritium sights safe to use?

Tritium sights are considered safe for normal use since the tritium gas is sealed within the sight and does not emit hazardous rays. The amount of tritium used in these sights is minimal and does not pose a significant radiation risk to the user. However, it is recommended to wash hands after handling tritium sights and not to disassemble them, as this could potentially release the tritium gas.
