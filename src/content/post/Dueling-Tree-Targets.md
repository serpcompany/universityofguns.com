I've spent quite a bit of time testing out this Do All Outdoors 22 Spinner Rimfire target set, and I must say that it's become a crucial part of my daily shooting routine. This target set is specifically designed for soft-nosed. 22 pistol and rifle shooters, making it perfect for my practice sessions. The hands-free design, which allows the bullet force to spin the targets back into position, is incredibly convenient and user-friendly.

However, this issue can be resolved by adding more space between them or using a larger base for added stability on sandy or gravelly ground - something one reviewer found helpful in their own experience. Overall though despite these minor issues; this budget friendly option offers great value particularly as far as durability goes thanks largely due its all steel construction capable enough handling multiple hits from. 22 caliber rounds without sustaining any damage whatsoever – perfect addition to any backyard range! .
