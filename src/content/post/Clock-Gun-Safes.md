### [VEVOR 5 Gun Cabinet with Lock and Digital Keypad](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

My journey with the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe has been quite eventful. As a first-time gun owner, I was initially excited about the prospect of owning a solid gun cabinet that not only secures my beloved firearms, but also offers a space for document and paperwork storage. However, this excitement was short-lived as the cabinet's material was thin and flimsy, making it difficult to maintain its upright position without additional support, which wasn't great for a cabinet designed for heavy-duty firearms.

Nevertheless, the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe did shine in certain areas. The digital keypad allowed for quick access and the cabinet's interior was well-lit, making it easy to locate specific items in low-light conditions. It also came with a removable shelf, allowing for customizable storage configurations based on my needs.

Despite providing decent basic security, the cabinet didn't offer much room for document storage, which turned out to be a major downside. In addition, the cabinet's quality fell short of my expectations, leaving much to be desired in terms of durability and overall build quality.

Overall, while the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe offered some useful features, it was a lackluster experience due to its low-quality material and limited storage capabilities. However, for gun enthusiasts on a budget who prioritize basic firearm security, this cabinet may be worth considering.

The fixed metal shelf allows me to neatly store ammunition and other supplies, while the plastic barrel rest kit prevents any damage to the firearms. Additionally, the two plastic door organizer bins are perfect for keeping smaller items in order.

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks worth mentioning. The top shelf may not be deep enough to accommodate scoped rifles or shotguns, which could make storing longer firearms difficult. Furthermore, the foam backing for the cabinet is incredibly sticky, and it was challenging for me to install without getting it all tangled up.

Overall, I am very pleased with the Homak 8-Gun Steel Security Cabinet (Black). It offers excellent protection for my valuables and blends seamlessly into my home decor. If you are in the market for a reasonably priced gun cabinet, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

### [Secure 24-gun Fire-resistant Safe with Dial Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/clock-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="tracker-safe-t593024m-dlg-gun-safe-in-black-with-dial-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tracker-safe-t593024m-dlg-gun-safe-in-black-with-dial-lock-1/public"/></a></div>

What I found particularly impressive was its versatility; it comes equipped with an internal electrical outlet and door organizer, allowing for optimal storage and organization.
