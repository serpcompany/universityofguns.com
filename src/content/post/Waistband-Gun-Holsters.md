I started using the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System recently and found it to be one of the most comfortable concealed carry solutions I've used so far. The holster material, aeroprene, is incredibly soft and breathable, making it great for wearing all day even in hot weather. I have tested its versatility by carrying my pistol both under an untucked shirt and higher up under my left arm to mimic a shoulder carry, with the belt loop providing excellent retention for a secure fit.

What impressed me about this product was its ability to accommodate any size pistol and any size Inside-the-Waistband (IWB) holster. My experimentation with various holsters on the belly band has proven that this product can cater to different preferences and body types very well – thanks to its hook-and-loop adjustable fit feature.

Overall, I would highly recommend the STRAPT-TAC Belly Band Holster System for anyone in search of an adaptable concealed carry solution that provides comfort without compromising security.
