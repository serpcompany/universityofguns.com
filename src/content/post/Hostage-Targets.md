### [Action Target Green Qualification Paper Targets (100 Pack)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/action-tgt-b-21e-100pk-green-1/public"/></a></div>

What I love most is the variety of target shapes available that replicate real-life attackers, making my practice sessions more effective in preparing me for actual threats.

At this affordable price point, you can't go wrong with these targets. There were some minor issues like damaged targets due to shipping mishandling, but overall, they have greatly improved my shooting game. If you're looking for high-quality targets without breaking the bank, give Action Targets a try!

### [High Quality Heavy Duty Sharpshooter Spinner Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-sharpshooter-spinner-target-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new targets to mix up my practice sessions. When I came across the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target, I knew I had to give it a shot. This sturdy target, made of heavy steel, boasts two targets of different sizes - a 2 1/4" one and a slightly larger 3 5/8" one.

What I particularly appreciated about this target was its versatility. Designed for use with soft nosed. 22 rimfire rifles and handguns, it provides a fun challenge even for experienced shooters like myself. However, be sure to avoid using it with centerfire handguns or rifles, as this could cause damage to both the target and your weapon.

Another highlight of this target is its distinct American make and quality. Crafted in the USA, it certainly stands out from other imported targets that may lack the same level of durability.

However, there are some cons to consider as well. Some users have reported difficulties hitting the smaller disc at longer distances due to its size. Additionally, the target does not deform on impact with some bullet types, which can cause wear and tear over time.

Overall, the Birchwood Casey Sharpshooter Spinner Target is an enjoyable addition to any shooting range. Its quality build, different target sizes, and American origin make it a solid choice for those looking to add some variety to their practice sessions.

### [AR500 Steel Hostage Target with Swivel Paddle](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/highwild-ar500-steel-hostage-target-7-x-12-x-3-8-armored-steel-reactive-idpa-shooting-target-neon-co-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I recently got a chance to try out the Highwild AR500 Steel Hostage Target. I've always found shooting targets to be quite monotonous, but this one added a whole new level of fun and excitement.

First off, it includes a 7-inch by 12-inch AR500 hostage target along with a 2-½ inch AR500 top swivel paddle, which really made shooting more interactive and engaging. The swivel paddle uses gravity to swing from side to side while shooting, adding an extra challenge that kept me on my toes.

One thing that stood out was the patented connection structure. It allowed the swivel paddle to move more steadily and smoothly, making the entire process a lot smoother and more enjoyable. Plus, if you're not in the mood for swinging, the swivel paddle can be easily removed.

Another great feature was the laser-cut AR500 steel plate. This made the target incredibly durable, capable of withstanding most pistol and rifle calibers, including popular ones like 9mm, 45ACP, . 223, 30-06, and 308.

But what really sealed the deal for me was the satisfying "Ding" sound you hear when you hit the target. It's a small detail, but it's incredibly rewarding and a surefire way to know when you've made a successful shot.

However, there are a few minor cons to consider. For one, the target is unpainted, so you'll need to apply your own paint to make sure you can see the shots clearly. Additionally, the distance recommended for usage with handguns (10 yards) might be a bit too close for some shooters, though it's understandable given the high power of the target.

All in all, this Highwild AR500 Steel Hostage Target has been an exciting addition to my range shooting. Its reactive and interactive nature keeps things fun and engaging, making shooting targets a lot more enjoyable. While it might not be perfect, its pros far outweigh the cons, making it a solid choice for those looking to add a little excitement to their shooting sessions.

### [7"x12" AR500 Hostage Target with Pistol & Rifle Compatibility](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="7-x-12-x-3-8-ar500-steel-hostage-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/7-x-12-x-3-8-ar500-steel-hostage-target-1/public"/></a></div>

As a shooting enthusiast, I've been using the 7" x 12" x 3/8" AR500 Steel Hostage Target for a few months now, and I can say it's definitely added some excitement to my range sessions.

One of the standout features for me has been the swivel paddle. It uses gravity to swing back and forth while shooting, adding a fun and dynamic element to the experience. Plus, its patented connection structure makes for a smoother and more stable movement.

The laser-cut design of the target itself is another highlight. It's precise and durable, made from 3/8" AR500 steel plate. It's suitable for most pistols and rifles, even high-powered ones like. 223, 30-06, and 308. However, I've noticed that the closer you get with handguns (10 yards) and rifles (100 yards), the more you risk damaging the target.

The best part about this hostage target, though, is the satisfying "Ding" sound it makes when you hit it. It's like a mini-victory each time, and it's a great motivator during practice. However, one downside is that it doesn't come pre-painted, so you'll need to paint it yourself before use.

Overall, I've had a lot of fun with this AR500 Steel Hostage Target. It's definitely a step up from traditional static targets, and it's perfect for those who want to add a bit of challenge and excitement to their range sessions.

### [Dirty Bird Hostage Target for Shooting Training](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hostage-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-hostage-12x18-target-8pk-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-dirty-bird-hostage-12x18-target-8pk-1/public"/></a></div>

As a passionate shooter, I've always found myself in search of the perfect target to help me improve my accuracy and overall skills. When I came across the Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Hostage Targets, I knew I had to give them a try. These targets are made with the highest quality materials and are perfect for all firearms and calibers.

One of the most impressive aspects of these targets is their unique design. Upon impact, the targets create a splattering effect with a burst of white, allowing you to quickly and easily spot each shot without any confusion. This feature not only makes it easier to assess your performance, but also adds an element of fun to the process. Additionally, these targets are available in an affordable 8-pack, making them a great value for the price.

The targets also come with an aiming point, making them suitable for both open and scoped sights. Another great feature of these targets is their non-adhesive back. This allows you to attach and remove the targets without any damage, enabling you to add notes or save them for future reference.

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. While the splattering effect does make it easy to spot your shots, it does make it slightly more difficult to analyze the accuracy of specific shots. Additionally, the non-adhesive back can sometimes result in the targets shifting during use, which can be slightly frustrating.

All in all, the Birchwood Casey Dirty Bird Hostage Targets are an excellent choice for any shooter looking to improve their skills and have a little fun in the process. While they may not be perfect, they offer a unique and enjoyable shooting experience that is hard to find elsewhere. So, why not give them a try?
