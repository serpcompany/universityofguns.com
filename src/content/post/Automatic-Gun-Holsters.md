<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="bulldog-cases-belt-slide-medium-automatic-handgun-holster-right-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-cases-belt-slide-medium-automatic-handgun-holster-right-1/public"/></a></div>

Since using the Bulldog Belt Slide Medium Automatic Handgun Holster Right Hand Leather Black MLBM for a couple of months, I can honestly say it's become my go-to choice. The high-quality leather is not only durable but also has a sleek appearance that complements any outfit.

Designed to fit most medium-sized automatics, this holster does an excellent job at providing a snug fit, while also accommodating some larger and smaller handguns. The pancake design allows for easy concealment while remaining comfortable throughout the day.

What really stands out about this holster is the cant angle, which offers incredible comfort despite its minimalist design. Drawing my weapon is effortless due to the accessibility of the holster – a feature that truly sets it apart from other similar products on the market. Plus, it's very reasonably priced!

Overall, this product delivers on its promises and is definitely worth considering if you're in need of an effective gun holster.

### [Level 3 Retention Auto Lock Duty Holster for Colt 1911](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-serpa-level-3-auto-lock-duty-holsters-colt-1911-right-hand-matte-black-44h103bk-r-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-serpa-level-3-auto-lock-duty-holsters-colt-1911-right-hand-matte-black-44h103bk-r-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the BlackHawk SERPA Level 3 Auto Lock Duty Holsters for Colt 1911 for a while now and I must say that it has exceeded my expectations. The intuitive L-shaped button, which optimizes security and performance, is something that truly stood out to me.

One of the features I appreciate most about this holster is the SERPA patented Auto-Lock technology. This ensures that my weapon is securely locked in place until I am ready to draw it. Another great aspect of this holster is the adjustable retention detent screw, which allows me to customize the level of retention according to my preferences.

It's also worth mentioning how easy it was to adapt this holster into my daily routine thanks to its thumb-activated Pivot Guard and full-length holster body that protects the rear sights of my gun. Additionally, both mid-ride duty belt loop and high-ride duty belt loop provide a comfortable fit on my belt without compromising security or accessibility (sold separately).

Overall, I highly recommend BlackHawk SERPA Level 3 Auto Lock Duty Holsters if you're looking for reliable protection and performance in a holster designed specifically for your firearm model.

### [Level IV Retention Duty Holster with Automatic Locking System (ALS)](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

The Safariland 6360 Level III Retention Duty Holster impressed me with its thoughtful design and secure retention features. It uses the Automatic Locking System (ALS) to keep my weapon safe while still allowing for a smooth, straight-up draw motion when needed. The mid-ride belt loop keeps the holster snugly against my body while also providing excellent protection for my firearm.

After using the holster for several months, I found that it smoothed out nicely with use, making my draw motions fluid and easy. I appreciate the felt lining for preserving my gun's finish. Initially, I had to get used to the double security system which required sliding back the hood before drawing my weapon. However, with some practice, it became second nature and I now feel confident in this system's ability to maintain complete security of my weapon until I am ready to draw it.

One minor critique is that due to the design of my light attached on my gun (TRL1), some adjustment was needed in terms of finding a comfortable position while seated in a car with bucket seats. However, after making slight adjustments over a few days on belt placement, I found an optimal spot that works well for me.

Overall, this is an excellent level III retention duty holster that provides maximum security without sacrificing quick accessibility when needed. Highly recommended!

### [Automatic Locking System Holster for Mid-Ride Retention](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

As a writer who has tried the Safariland 6360 Level III Retention Duty Holster, I can confidently say that it's an exceptional product. The Automatic Locking System (ALS) and Self Locking System (SLS) work together to provide multiple layers of retention, giving me peace of mind when carrying my Glock 19.

The holster is made from durable leather-look SafariLaminate construction and rides close to the body, providing comfort even during extended periods of wear. The suede lining helps protect the gun's sights and finish from scratches or damage. Drawing my weapon feels smooth after practice with no twisting required, thanks to its operable thumb mechanism which allows for a straight draw out of the holster.

While some users have mentioned minor concerns with adjustments due to seat conditions or issues with weapon fit, I found it easy to adapt after a few days of use. It's important to note that individual experiences may vary based on different environments and circumstances, but this product has proven reliable for law enforcement and armed security roles. If you're looking for a dependable level III retention duty holster – Safariland 6360 should be at the top of your list!

### [Ambidextrous Water-Resistant Nylon Holster for Automatic Pistols with Laser or Tactical Light](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-w-laser-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bulldog-extreme-5-ambi-auto-w-laser-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Bulldog Extreme Pistol Holster for a while now, and I’m pretty impressed with its durability and functionality. The holster is made from water-resistant nylon and has fused padding for extra protection. It comes with additional features such as an ambidextrous belt loop, metal clip, soft scratch-resistant inner lining, spine protector, and compatibility with standard 2"-5" barrel autos with laser or tac light.

My experience so far has been great! The holster fits my pistol securely and keeps it safe from scratches or other damages. The design allows for both right-handed and left-handed users to wear it comfortably on their belts. However, one thing to note is that the holster might not be suitable for inside the waistband carry due to its large size – something to keep in mind if you prefer carrying your firearm this way.

Overall, the Bulldog Extreme Pistol Holster is a good choice for those looking for a durable and comfortable option for their daily carry needs; just watch out for any potential issues with stitching over time!

### [Secure Open-Top Paddle Holster with ALS for Glock 20/21](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I have been using the Safariland 6378 holster for my Glock 17/22 for a while now, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. The ALS (Automatic Locking System) feature is a game-changer, ensuring that my weapon is securely locked in place while still allowing for an easy draw with just a swipe of my thumb.

The construction of this holster is impressive, made from SafariLaminate material that's strong on the outside and soft on the inside with its SafariSuede lining, which protects my firearm's front sight and finish. It's not only durable but also comfortable to wear all day long.

One aspect of this holster that sets it apart from others is its versatility, as it comes with both paddle and belt loop attachments. I can easily switch how I carry my gun based on what works best for me at any given time - whether it's on my hip or tucked away under a jacket. The high carrying position makes concealment a breeze.

Overall, the Safariland 6378 Holster stands out among other holsters in terms of quality, security features and functionality, making it an ideal choice for everyday carry or professional use. It has exceeded my expectations and has become an essential part of my everyday carry setup.

### [Safariland ALS Paddle Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-149-413" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6378-als-paddle-holster-6378-149-413/public"/></a></div>

After using the holster for my Glock 21, I can confidently say that it has exceeded my expectations in terms of security and comfort. The "ALS (Automatic Locking System)" feature adds an extra layer of protection by locking the weapon in place when holstered, while still allowing for a smooth draw when needed.

The SafariLaminate construction provides strong outer protection for your firearm, while the SafariSuede on the inside preserves your gun's sights and finish from potential scratches and wear. One advantageous feature is how well the holster fits to my body, allowing me to carry my Glock 21 discreetly all day long without any discomfort. Additionally, I appreciate the ease of putting on and taking off with the included concealment paddle.

However, there are a few limitations to be aware of. For instance, it may take some time to get used to deactivating the ALS before drawing your weapon. Also, while it does fit most 1. 5" - 1. 75" belts securely, users with smaller or larger belts may need additional accessories for compatibility. Overall, this product delivers quality and convenience in a reliable holster for compatible firearms like my Glock 21.

### [Concealable Belt Holster for Glock 19/23/32 - Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-gunleather-concealable-belt-handgun-holster-glock-19-23-32-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-gunleather-concealable-belt-handgun-holster-glock-19-23-32-black-1/public"/></a></div>

The concealment holster from this brand is a top-notch product that offers exceptional performance, comfort and durability.

The holster hugs my body close, providing excellent concealment without drawing unwanted attention in public settings.

Made from premium materials, this holster has proven to be sturdy and reliable, giving me peace of mind knowing my firearm is safe at all times. Its leather molding feature adds even more to the comfort and ease of use. Although there was a minor break-in period with adjusting the retention screws for a perfect fit, it's not too significant once you learn how to do it properly through the manufacturer's instructional videos found on their website (which also has great customer service).

While some users might prefer more affordable alternatives if they are on a tight budget as these come at slightly higher prices due to their superior craftsmanship/quality standards met during production process that justifies the premium pricing structure overall though! Overall I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for an excellent concealment holster option 😊👍

### [Left-Handed Automatic Inside-the-Pant Holster for Medium Autos](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89013" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89013/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Uncle Mike's Barrel Automatic Inside The Pant Holster Left Hand Plain Black 89012 and I must say, it's a reliable option for concealed carry. This holster is designed with a unique ultra-thin four layer laminate, making it just as thin as conventional suede leather holsters. What really impressed me was the internal moisture barrier that prevents sweat from touching your gun, keeping it clean and dry throughout the day. Additionally, the smooth nylon lining allows for an easy draw and adds to the comfort of wearing this holster for extended periods.

The suede-like exterior anchors the concealment holster inside pants or skirts without slipping or being easily dislodged - this feature definitely stands out in terms of functionality. There are two options available: an open style or one equipped with a fold-over retention strap that releases quickly with thumb pressure and meets safety requirements of many jurisdictions.

A few users have reported instability issues with the belt clip; however, I found that placing the clip over both your pants waistband and belt before buckling up helps prevent this problem while ensuring secure placement during use. Overall, despite some minor flaws experienced by certain users (which may vary based on individual body types/carrying preferences), this is an excellent budget-friendly choice for those looking for an effective concealment solution when carrying medium automatics like Glock Models 17 &19; Springfield XDS/XDm series; Ruger SR9/KP series etcetera.

### [Comfortable Inside-the-Pant Holster for Large Automatic Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/automatic-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89053" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uncle-mikes-barrel-automatic-inside-the-pant-holster-left-hand-plain-black-89053/public"/></a></div>

After using the Uncle Mike's Barrel Automatic Inside the Pant Holster for some time now, I must say that it does have its pros and cons. The unique four-layer laminate construction keeps the holster lightweight and comfortable enough to wear all day long. Additionally, this holster's ultra-thin design ensures effortless concealment under clothing, making it perfect for everyday use. The internal moisture barrier also prevents sweat from transferring to your firearm, keeping it in pristine condition.

However, there are a few downsides worth mentioning. Firstly, the belt clip isn’t as sturdy as I would have liked; it can become loose when sitting or crouching which means repositioning is necessary during wear. Also, while the retention is sufficient most of the time, there were instances where my gun felt less secure than desired; an improved retention system would be a great addition to this holster. Lastly, this product lacks any quick-release features or extra security measures that might appeal to those with specific needs in mind.

Despite these minor issues though, taking into account the price point and overall comfortability offered by this holster makes it a decent option for concealed carry enthusiasts who are looking for something affordable yet effective in securing their weapon throughout daily activities.
