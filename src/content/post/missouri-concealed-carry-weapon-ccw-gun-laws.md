Missouri: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Missouri is a permitless carry state as well as a shall-issue state. Permits are issued for reciprocity purposes, at the local level by county sheriffs. 


There is no permit, background check or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.


Open carry and concealed carry are legal in Missouri without a Concealed Carry Permit (CCP) for anyone 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm (18 for members of the military or honorably discharged). Local authorities can restrict concealed carry in any building owned, leased or controlled by the county or municipality and may require a CCP for open carry. Missouri law does not plainly state you don’t need a permit to carry. They changed the definition of “unlawful use of a weapon” to only apply when a person carries a weapon into a place that is off-limits per Missouri law.

To obtain a Missouri CCP, you must be at least 19 years old (18 for members of the military or honorably discharged) and have passed a firearms training course. The application must be made in your county of residence. Non-resident permits are only available to persons who are on active military duty or veterans who are at least 18 years old and stationed in Missouri. There are a number of restricted locations including courthouses and public passenger buses and trains. Since permitless carry is legal in Missouri, anyone 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit.

### Self-Defense


Missouri is a Castle Doctrine state and became the 25th state to adopt a “stand your ground” law. It empowers gun owners to defend themselves outside of their homes or properties. Individuals are not required to retreat, wherever they may lawfully be, prior to using deadly force. This assumes the person was not the initial aggressor and is not attempting to commit a crime. [[3](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=563.031&bid=33873&hl=)]


#### Physical force is justifiable:


* When an individual believes that the physical force used is necessary for the defense of themselves (or others) from an attack of unlawful force from another person.
* When an individual believes that the force is reasonably necessary to prevent another person from stealing, damaging or tampering with property.


#### Deadly force is justifiable:


* When an individual reasonably believes that the force is necessary for self-defense or defense of others (including unborn children) to prevent death, serious physical injury or a forcible felony.
* When an individual uses such force against a person who unlawfully enters a dwelling, residence or vehicle.
* When an individual uses such force against a person who unlawfully enters, attempts to enter or remains after unlawfully entering private property where the owner of authorized individual claims justification for using protective force under this law.


In 2016, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District held in State v. Whipple that deadly force under the castle doctrine can only be used when you reasonably believe such force is necessary to protect yourself or someone else from “the use or imminent use of unlawful force” and not solely to protect property. Missouri law also prohibits political subdivisions to preclude the use of firearms to defend people or property.
