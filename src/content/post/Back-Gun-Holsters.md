The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster.

As soon as I put it on, the first thing that stood out was how incredibly comfortable it was. The premium steerhide material felt great against my skin, and the spider harness ensured a perfect fit no matter what size shirt I wore.

One of the things I appreciated most about this holster is how easy it is to use. The fully modular design makes it simple to put on and take off, even when you're in a hurry. Plus, the optional accessories and components allow you to customize your carry method to suit your needs perfectly.

However, there are some downsides to consider. The initial tightness of the holster can be a bit daunting, but following the break-in instructions will help alleviate this issue. Additionally, some users may find the learning curve for adjusting the spider harness to be somewhat steep.

### [Ruger 57 Speed Scabbard Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-002-speed-scabbard-holster-rh-tan-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-002-speed-scabbard-holster-rh-tan-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the Desantis 002 Speed Scabbard holster in my daily life, and I have to say, it's a game-changer for those who prefer a holster without a thumb break. The first thing that struck me about this holster was its precise fit. It's designed to accommodate the Ruger 57 with or without red dot sights, and it held my firearm securely without any issues.

One of the standout features of this holster is its forward rake. This design allows for a smoother, more natural draw, which can make all the difference in high-pressure situations. Additionally, the Speed Scabbard holster includes a tension screw device, which can be adjusted to further enhance your ability to retain your firearm.

Although I'm right-handed, I appreciate that this holster is available in a right-hand draw configuration, ensuring that it meets the needs of both left- and right-handed users. Made of high-quality leather and crafted in the USA, this holster offers durability and reliability.

While there's not much to complain about, some users might find that the lack of a thumb break could be a disadvantage, as it may not provide the same level of security as other holsters on the market.

### [Versacarry Distressed Brown OWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-guardian-owb-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

Finding the perfect holster can be a daunting task, but the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made it an enjoyable experience for me. As someone who carries a full-sized 1911, I was initially skeptical about how concealable it would be. However, the forward cant design ensures the gun stays tight against my body, while the raised protective backing provides both comfort and protection.

One of the things that stood out for me was the unique leather material; made from premium water buffalo leather, it's not only durable but also breaks in incredibly fast. I'm also thrilled with the right-handed draw feature which suits my dominance perfectly. The fact that it's handcrafted in the USA and backed by a lifetime warranty just adds more value to this already amazing product.

However, one minor con is that there could be more size options to cater to various types of guns. But with the available sizes fitting most compact, full-sized, and subcompact handguns, it is still a versatile choice for many.

All in all, the VersaCarry Guardian OWB Holster has made concealed carry comfortable and secure for me. It's truly a best buy for the money! "

### [VersaCarry Mayhem Right-Handed Shoulder Holster for Glock 19](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="versacarry-mayhem-shoulder-holster-glock-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/versacarry-mayhem-shoulder-holster-glock-20/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the VersaCarry Mayhem Shoulder Holster for my Glock 19 for a while now, and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer. Gone are the days of straining my back and hips with a bulky belt-mounted holster. This shoulder rig truly delivers all-day carry comfort.

The ergonomically designed leather straps distribute the weight evenly across my shoulders, saving my lumbar region from unnecessary strain. The fully adjustable design ensures it fits most people comfortably, and the molded polymer holster hugs my Glock 19 like a second skin. The thumb-break strap gives me the peace of mind that my firearm isn't going anywhere unless I want it to.

The dual off-hand magazine pouches are an excellent addition, allowing me to carry enough firepower to handle any situation. The adjustable belt loop straps provide extra stability and ensure the holster stays put even during intense physical activity. And did I mention that it's optics compatible? Talk about versatility!

On the downside, the polymer material isn't as luxurious as premium leather. However, the benefits of the lighter, more comfortable design outweigh the minor loss in aesthetic appeal for me. All in all, the VersaCarry Mayhem Shoulder Holster gets the job done, and it does so in absolute comfort.

### [Galco MIami Classic II Shoulder Holster for Sig P365, Premium Leather Concealment, Comfortable Spider Harness, Modular Design](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-miami-classic-ii-shoulder-holster-black-sig-p365-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-miami-classic-ii-shoulder-holster-black-sig-p365-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Galco Miami Classic II Shoulder Holster and let me tell you, it's a game-changer! This beauty is not only sleek and stylish but also incredibly comfortable to wear. The premium steerhide holster and magazine carrier make it feel like you're carrying a piece of quality craftsmanship.

One of my favorite features is the horizontal double magazine carrier with an open front - it makes reloading super quick and easy. And let's not forget about those comfortable medium-width harness straps and the full-grain leather harness with a swiveling Flexalon back plate, which ensures a perfect fit no matter your size or shape. Plus, you can add tie-downs, cuff cases, or flashlight attachments for extra convenience.

However, there are some cons that I need to mention. While walking my dog, both spare 15rd magazines worked their way out of their little leather homes and fell into the inside of my jacket. This could have been avoided if the magazine pouches were more secure.

All in all, I am absolutely thrilled with the Galco Miami Classic II Shoulder Holster! The quality is top-notch, and I feel confident knowing that it's going to last me a long time. If you're in the market for a new concealed carrying solution, I highly recommend giving this holster a try.

### [Galco Classic Lite 2.0 Shoulder Gun Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-classic-lite-2-0-shoulder-system-cl2-203" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-classic-lite-2-0-shoulder-system-cl2-203/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've tried countless holster systems over the years. When I heard about the Galco Classic Lite 2.0 Shoulder System, I was intrigued. To my delight, it did not disappoint.

The horizontal carry position makes reaching for my weapon quick and easy. The steerhide material is hardy and shows no signs of wear even after months of use. Not to mention, it looks incredibly sleek.

One feature that really stood out for me is the vertical double magazine carrier with secure flaps. It's so reassuring knowing I always have a full magazine at the ready. Moreover, the comfortable medium-width harness with swiveling Flexalon backplate ensures a snug fit without digging into my shoulders.

However, this system isn't perfect. The lack of adjustability in the magazine carriers can be a bit frustrating when swapping between magazines of different sizes. But it's not a deal breaker by any means.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a stylish yet functional shoulder holster system, look no further than the Galco Classic Lite 2.0. Its durable construction and practical design make it a reliable choice in any shooting situation.

### [Galco Classic Lite 2.0 Right-Handed J-Frame Leather Shoulder Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="galco-classic-lite-2-0-j-frame-rh-natural-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galco-classic-lite-2-0-j-frame-rh-natural-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the opportunity to test out the Galco Classic Lite 2.0 J-Frame RH Natural and I must say, it's been a real game-changer for me. As someone who needs to carry a firearm on a daily basis, finding a comfortable and reliable holster is absolutely crucial. That's where this little beauty comes in.

Right off the bat, what stood out to me was the use of premium center cut steerhide in its construction. The quality of this material is evident as soon as you touch it - it's soft, supple, and just feels like it's built to last. And let me tell you, after using it for a few weeks now, I can confirm that it definitely is.

One of my favorite things about this holster is how adjustable it is. The medium-width harness can be fitted perfectly to your body shape, ensuring that the holster stays snug and secure no matter how much movement you make. This is especially important for those of us who need to carry our firearms over extended periods, as discomfort can quickly become an issue.

Another feature I really appreciated was the horizontal gun carry design. While some might prefer a vertical orientation, there's something about the way this one hugs your body that just feels more secure. Plus, the vertical ammo carrier with secure flap ensures that your ammunition stays put, even during some pretty intense physical activity.

Now, I will say that there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this holster. For one, it doesn't come with any tie-downs or cuff case attachments, which would've been a nice touch for those of us who carry more than just our firearms. Additionally, while the swiveling Flexalon backplate does provide some added flexibility, it can be a bit tricky to figure out at first.

But overall, I am absolutely thrilled with my experience using the Galco Classic Lite 2.0 J-Frame RH Natural. Its combination of quality materials, adjustable fit, and secure design make it the perfect choice for anyone in need of a reliable shoulder holster.

### [T-Series L3D Duty Holster: Streamlined, Secure Protection](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="t-series-l3d-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/t-series-l3d-duty-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I decided to upgrade my old holster for my Sig Sauer 320 handgun. Out of all the options available on the market, I was drawn to the T-Series L3D Duty Holster, and boy, am I glad I made that decision!

The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design. The holster is made from a blend of durable reinforced polymer material and low-friction internal materials, which not only make it look cool but also provide a smooth, stealthy pulling motion. Plus, the hydrophobic lining ensures that it stays dry no matter how sweaty the situation gets.

One of the standout features of this holster is the streamlined thumb-activated Level 3 retention. I've been in a few tense situations, and I can attest to the fact that it allows for efficient drawing even under extreme pressure. With a quick flick of my thumb, I'm ready to take on whatever comes my way.

Another aspect of the T-Series L3D Duty Holster that I truly appreciate is the strap that goes over the back of the slide. This extra layer of security gives me peace of mind knowing that my handgun is securely in place at all times.

Now, let's talk about the cons. There's not much to complain about with this holster, but one minor issue is that it comes with a Jacket Slot Belt Loop already attached. Fortunately, other options like the QDR and 2-Slot Belt Loops are available for purchase separately, so it's not a dealbreaker.

In conclusion, the T-Series L3D Duty Holster has been a game-changer for me. Its combination of style, efficiency, and security makes it the perfect companion for my Sig Sauer 320 handgun. If you're in the market for a new holster, I highly recommend giving this one a try. You won't be disappointed!

### [Inner Waistband Holster for Sig P365](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/back-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crossbreed-reckoning-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

While I've always been a fan of traditional leather holsters, the Crossbreed Reckoning Holster has been a game-changer for me. The moment I put it on, I could feel the difference - it's light, comfortable, and fits perfectly for my Sig P365. The right-hand draw has made my draw speed effortless, and the inside-the-waistband design allows me to keep my Sig concealed without compromising on accessibility.

What really impresses me about this holster is its personalization potential. As someone who likes to fine-tune things to cater to my own needs, the multiple points of retention adjustment have been a boon. I can adjust the screws to fit my gun perfectly, and the retention device under the trigger guard ensures that my Sig stays put.

Another feature I appreciate is the combination of Kydex pocket and leather backer. The Kydex gives me the confidence of a secure hold, while the leather backer adds comfort when the holster is worn for extended periods.

However, the holster could benefit from some minor improvements. The visible cross icons on the belt loops feel a bit too conspicuous for my taste when it comes to a truly discreet IWB holster. Additionally, it might be convenient if there was a version of this holster that came equipped with an attachable mag carrier.

In conclusion, the Crossbreed Reckoning Holster offers a perfect blend of comfort and functionality. It's been a reliable companion while I'm on-the-go, which makes me extremely happy with my purchase.
