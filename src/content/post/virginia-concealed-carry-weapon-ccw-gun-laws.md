Virginia: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Virginia is a shall-issue state where residents can file their application for a concealed handgun permit with the circuit court in their county of residence, and non-residents must mail their application to the State Police. 


There is no permit or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual, provided the buyer and seller are both Virginia residents. (Source: [VA Code § 18.2-308.2](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.2/))


Open carry is legal in Virginia without a permit for anyone who is at least 18 years old and can legally possess a firearm. (Source: [VA Code § 18.2-287.4](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-287.4/))


### Self-Defense


Virginia case law supports self-defense, a version of the castle doctrine, and stand your ground in certain circumstances. There is no duty to retreat, and you can defend yourself at any location you are legally permitted to be. (Source: [VA Code § 18.2-308.2](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-308.2/))


#### Defense of Self or Others


Virginia law allows the use of self-defense where a person, who is not the aggressor:


* Reasonably believes the person is in imminent danger of an overt act threatening unlawful force, serious bodily harm or death; and
* Uses the amount of force reasonable in relation to the threat.


A person may only use deadly force if there was a present danger of great bodily injury. An individual is allowed to defend not only his or her person from harm if the person being defended would have been justified in using self-defense. (Source: [VA Code § 18.2-283](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-283/))


#### Defense of Dwelling


Although Virginia law does not allow deadly force to prevent an entry into a home or dwelling, non-deadly force may be used to prevent an unlawful entry into a dwelling. Deadly force is only justified in circumstances where a person reasonably believes the intruder will commit great bodily injury or death. (Source: [VA Code § 18.2-283.1](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-283.1/))
