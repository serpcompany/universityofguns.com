Iowa: Gun Laws Summary
----------------------


Iowa is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with two types of permits available: professional and non-professional. Professional permits are issued to individuals at least 18 years of age that are employed in a capacity that reasonably justifies that person going armed. Non-professional permits are issued to individuals at least 21 years of age that meet permit requirements, including training. As of July 1, 2021, in order to acquire a pistol or revolver from a federally licensed firearms dealer, an unlicensed person is required to have a valid permit to acquire, a valid permit to carry weapons or the person must complete a satisfactory national instant criminal background check. There is no waiting period or firearms registration in the state. [[source](https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/iowa/)]

#### Use of Deadly Force

* The person against whom force is used is doing any of the following:
	+ Unlawfully entered by force or stealth or entering by force or stealth the dwelling, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force;
	+ Unlawfully removing or attempting to unlawfully remove another person against the other person’s will from the dwelling, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force.


#### Defense of Property


A person is justified in the use of reasonable force to prevent or terminate criminal interference with the person’s possession or other right in property and to aid another in the lawful defense of the other person’s rights in property or in any public property.


#### Civil Immunity


A person who is justified in using reasonable force against an aggressor in defense of oneself, another person or property is immune from criminal or civil liability for all damages incurred by the aggressor pursuant to the application of reasonable force.

The [application for a Permit to Acquire](https://dps.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/administrative-services/weapons/AppPermitAcquirePistolRevolver.pdf) is processed at the county level and is valid for 5 years after the date it is issued. Some counties accept online applications, others accept them by mail, but most require an application to be submitted at the county sheriff’s office in person. To see if your county of residence accepts online permits, check the county sheriff’s office website directly. In order to obtain a Permit to Acquire, you will need a valid driver’s license or state-issued ID and will have to pay a fee. A National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check will be processed. The processing time to obtain a Permit to Acquire will differ county by county and may take up to 10 days. The permit itself is not valid until 3 days after the date it is issued. |
