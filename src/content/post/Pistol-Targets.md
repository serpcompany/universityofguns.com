I recently used Tannerite Brand Targets for some target practice and it was such a fun experience! The unique feature of these targets is their ability to create an audible explosion and cloud of vapor when hit with high velocity ammunition. This added an exciting element to shooting, making it enjoyable for me and my friends.

Setting up the targets is a breeze - simply mix the two stable compounds together in equal parts. I found using them at 200 yards to be quite satisfying. Safety-wise, these targets are designed not to be flammable or cause fire hazards during transportation or usage, which gave me peace of mind while using them outdoors or in my backyard shooting range. They're specifically made for use with high velocity ammunition, ensuring no accidental explosion from low-powered rounds like pistol shots or rimfire ammunition.

As an avid handgun enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Ar500 Dueling Tree target, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my practice sessions. This larger frame target carries six 6-inch diameter steel paddles, making it a perfect dueling tree for handguns ranging from 9mm to. 45ACP. The paddles are 3/8 inch thick USA-made Ar500 steel, ensuring durability and long-lasting performance.

One of the highlights of this dueling tree is its simplicity – no springs, mechanisms, or tools required for assembly. Just snap the pieces together, and you're good to go! Additionally, it comes with a hard molded carry case for easy transportation and storage. The dimensions of this target are 48.5 inches high, 28.5 inches wide, and 23 inches deep, making it relatively compact and portable.

However, as with any product, there are a few cons to consider. Some users have reported issues with the paint coming off the paddles after use.

### [Trouble-Shooter Handgun Target 19"x25" 100 Pack](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pistol-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pistol-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="trouble-shooter-handgun-diagnostic-19x25-paper-shooting-targets-100-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/trouble-shooter-handgun-diagnostic-19x25-paper-shooting-targets-100-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid shooter, I've had my fair share of struggles with handgun accuracy. The Trouble-Shooter Handgun Diagnostic targets turned out to be my saving grace. These 19"x25" paper targets are packed with 100 units, and they come in vibrant shades of yellow and red. The color contrast, combined with their high-quality paper, makes them incredibly easy to spot on the range.

One of the primary reasons I love these targets is their ability to help identify common shooting mistakes. There are eight detailed diagrams on each target, each representing a different error that shooters often make. After firing a few shots, I would compare my bullet groupings to these diagrams, and in no time, I could pinpoint where I was going wrong. Whether it was a misalignment of my grip or improper trigger control, the Trouble-Shooter made it easy to understand and rectify the issues.

Designed for both right and left-handed shooters, these targets are incredibly versatile. I've used them with a variety of sighting systems, including iron sights and red dot sights, and they have always performed impeccably. The fact that they can be used effectively at distances of 15 feet to 200 yards is just icing on the cake.

There is, however, one downside I've noticed while using these targets. They are made of paper, and as such, they are susceptible to tear and wear. This means I have to be extra careful while removing them from the target holder to avoid damaging them.

In conclusion, the Trouble-Shooter Handgun Diagnostic targets have been an invaluable addition to my shooting practice. They offer a simple and visually effective way to identify and correct common shooting mistakes. Plus, their high-quality construction, affordability, and wide range of applicability make them a must-have for any serious shooter.

### [Deluxe 10-count Pistol Target Set with Spinning Mechanism](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/pistol-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

I recently got my hands on the Gamo Deluxe Spinner Targets - a 10 count set designed to provide shooting enthusiasts with a versatile, fun, and challenging target system. It's no secret that as someone who loves honing their shooting skills, I was excited to see what this set had to offer.

First and foremost, the sturdy construction of the targets is definitely worth mentioning. They are made of solid metal and come with a glossy black finish which not only gives them a professional look but also ensures durability against impacts from pellets.

One unique feature of these targets is the ability to assemble them in multiple configurations. The tallest assembly can reach up to 35 inches high and 6 inches wide, allowing me to test my shooting accuracy from various angles.

However, there were some issues that stood out during my use of this product. The size of the targets might be an issue for some users, especially if they prefer larger targets for longer distances. Moreover, while the stickers provided are great for indicating hit spots, they do tend to come off after a few shots, making it difficult to track progress over time.

Despite these minor cons, I must say I've been thoroughly entertained using the Gamo Deluxe Spinner Targets. They offer a decent challenge and provide hours of fun target practice - perfect for both beginners and experienced shooters alike.
