South Dakota: Gun Laws Summary
------------------------------


South Dakota is a shall-issue, permitless carry state where no permits, firearms registration or background checks are required to buy a handgun from a private individual. Open carry is legal in South Dakota without a permit, and the minimum age is 18 years old. Handguns in a vehicle must be in plain sight, without a permit, based upon an unofficial 2004 Attorney General Opinion. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary and secondary schools and school buses.


### Concealed Carry in South Dakota


South Dakota is now a permitless carry state, so anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm, may concealed carry a firearm without a concealed carry permit. For reciprocity purposes, the state issues Concealed Pistol Permits (CPP) to residents as well as members of the military and their spouses stationed in South Dakota.


#### Types of Permits


There are three permits available in South Dakota:


* The Regular permit allows holders to carry concealed and is recognized in a number of other states.
* The Gold Card permit, in addition to the benefits of a regular permit, proves passage of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) when purchasing a firearm, resulting in no required waiting period.
* The Enhanced permit requires a firearms training course, provides the purchase background check exemption and is recognized in seven more states than the regular license.


#### Reciprocity


In terms of reciprocity, South Dakota recognizes permits issued by all States. 


### Self-Defense Laws in South Dakota


A person who is in a dwelling, residence or occupied vehicle in which the person has a right to be, has no duty to retreat, has the right to stand his or her ground, and has the right to use force if the person reasonably believes that using force is necessary to defend himself, herself, or another against the imminent use of unlawful force, and deadly force if the person reasonably believes that using deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself, herself, or another, or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm, to himself, herself, or another, when using or threatening to use defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm if the person against whom the defensive force was used, had unlawfully entered or was in the process of unlawfully entering a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle. A person is justified in using force, other than deadly force, against another if and to the extent the person reasonably believes that using force is necessary to prevent or terminate another’s trespass on, or criminal interference with real property other than a dwelling. A person is justified in using deadly force only if the person reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat and the person has the right to stand his or her ground, if the person is in a place where the person has a right to be. A person who uses or threatens to use force, as permitted in this statute, is justified and is immune from criminal prosecution and from civil liability for the use or threatened use of such force brought by the person against whom force was used or threatened.
