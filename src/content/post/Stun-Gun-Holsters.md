### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

This Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Bodyguard is a game-changer! As an everyday user, I can confidently say that it's light, tough, and secure, making it perfect for my daily life. I've been using it with my trusty Colt Officer ACP, and it fits like a glove.

The holster is made from 600-denier nylon, brushed nylon tricot lining, breathable open-cell foam, and closed cell foam. These four layers provide all-around protection that I can rely on. Plus, the belt loop attachment makes it easy to attach and adjust as needed.

On the downside, I've noticed that some users have had issues with the holster's adjustment system, which can be difficult to maneuver. However, this hasn't been a problem for me.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a comfortable, durable, and affordable hip holster, the Cabela's Ambidextrous Hip Holster - S&W Bodyguard is worth considering. Its high rating and versatility make it stand out among the competition. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!

### [Comfortable and Secure TASER 7 Holster with Quick Dual Release](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blackhawk-taser-7-black-holster-lh-44ht03bkl-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackhawk-taser-7-black-holster-lh-44ht03bkl-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Blackhawk Taser 7 Holster to enhance my personal protection setup. This holster has been a game-changer, bringing a level of convenience and efficiency that I haven't experienced before with other holsters. The unique cross draw design ensures that I can quickly and accurately draw my Taser 7, even under high stress situations. This quick draw feature is particularly crucial during emergencies when every second counts.

A standout feature for me is the holster's ability to automatically engage the safety when the Taser 7 is re-holstered. This added layer of protection gives me peace of mind knowing that my weapon is always secure when it's tucked away. The compatibility with Blackhawk duty platforms, such as belt loops, QD systems, MOLLE adapters, and tactical thigh platforms, makes this holster incredibly versatile and adaptable to different settings.

One minor downside is the slightly more complex draw motion compared to traditional handgun holsters. This may take some getting used to for those who are switching over. However, once you've mastered the technique, the benefits of the Blackhawk Taser 7 Holster far outweigh any initial learning curve. Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this holster to anyone seeking a reliable and effective way to carry their Taser 7.

### [Sturdy and Comfortable TASER Pulse IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="blade-tech-iwb-pulse-holster-30052" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blade-tech-iwb-pulse-holster-30052/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Blade-Tech IWB Pulse Holster (30051) and it's been a game-changer. This is the perfect carry system for my TASER Pulse device, providing both concealment and easy access.

One thing that really stands out about this holster is its adjustability. I can fine-tune the retention and angle, making it super comfortable to wear and easy to draw from. Plus, the positive lock trigger guard mechanism gives me an extra layer of security, letting me know my TASER Pulse is secure with a click.

Another great feature is that it was designed to be ambidextrous, allowing both right and left-handed individuals to use it effortlessly. And guess what? Its production process takes place right here in the USA, ensuring high-quality craftsmanship and precision moulding for a perfect fit.

However, there are some minor drawbacks. For instance, it doesn't have an automatic trigger guard lock or release, which could potentially make the draw process a bit slower. But overall, this holster has greatly improved my EDC setup and given me peace of mind knowing I have a reliable backup plan if needed.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a high-quality, reliable, and versatile holster for your TASER Pulse device, I'd highly recommend giving the Blade-Tech IWB Pulse Holster a try.

### [Ambidextrous Hip Holster for Glock 17/19](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-hip-holster-with-magazine-pouch-glock-17-20" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-hip-holster-with-magazine-pouch-glock-17-20/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who actually used the RangeMaxx Hip Holster with Magazine Pouch for Glock 17/19, I must say it's a promising addition to your gear arsenal. The ambidextrous design truly shines - whether you're left or right handed, it's tailored to suit your needs. The outer nylon shell gives off a tough vibe while the tricot interior gently cradles your firearm, ensuring its finish remains as good as new.

One standout feature is the built-in magazine pouch which offers a convenient place for your extra rounds, ensuring you're always prepared for more action. Its compact size, light weight, and durability will definitely come in handy when you're out there.

That being said, not everything was smooth sailing. The Velcro-based strap for adjusting retention wasn't very practical, especially when switching it over to left-handed use. Some users also reported issues with the magazine pouch, suggesting they had to modify it for proper usage. A potential drawback could be the snap's awkwardness, though it doesn't necessarily tarnish the holster's overall quality.

In conclusion, the RangeMaxx Hip Holster with Magazine Pouch is a decent choice for Glock 17/19 users on a budget. Despite a few hiccups, its ambidextrous design, built-in magazine pouch, and durability make up for the cons. Remember, not every product is perfect, but this one does offer some promising features at an affordable price.

### [Taser Bolt 2 Holster for Comfort and Convenience](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/stun-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="taser-bolt-2-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/taser-bolt-2-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Taser Bolt 2 Holster, and it has become a game-changer for me. I love how lightweight and travel-friendly it is, making it easy to carry around in my waistband or pocket without causing any discomfort. The universal clip with a removable metal attachment is also a bonus, as it provides versatility in terms of attachment options.

One of the highlights of this holster is its compatibility with the Taser Bolt 2. I found it incredibly secure, ensuring my device stays protected at all times. However, there was a minor downside - the clip can sometimes be a bit loose, which might cause the holster to come out when I try to remove the unit.

Despite this minor issue, I would definitely recommend the Taser Bolt 2 Holster for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable way to carry their stun gun.
