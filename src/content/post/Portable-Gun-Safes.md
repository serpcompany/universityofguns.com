### [Wyze Smart Gun Safe with Biometric and App Unlock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="wyze-smart-gun-safe-with-biometric-backlit-keypad-and-app-unlock-with-physical-key-interior-led-12-m-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wyze-smart-gun-safe-with-biometric-backlit-keypad-and-app-unlock-with-physical-key-interior-led-12-m-1/public"/></a></div>

The Wyze Gun Safe is a reliable and efficient security solution for your firearms. It offers multiple ways to access the safe, such as using a key, passcode, app, or fingerprint. The sturdy construction and well-designed interior provide ample space to securely store your handgun along with extra mags and small items.

One standout feature of this gun safe is the added security of requiring a password when accessing it through the app. However, there are some areas where improvements could be made: ensuring timely syncing between Bluetooth off-and-on statuses when logging activity and reducing the delay experienced when using the buttons on the safe itself.

Overall, I would recommend this product for its quality and reliability in maintaining safety for you and those around you. With its portable design, fingerprint sensor, app accessibility features; this gun safe brings smart integration to an affordable level making it accessible for many people looking to enhance their home security efforts.

### [VEVOR 5 Gun Cabinet with Lock and Digital Keypad](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-5-gun-safe-gun-security-cabinet-with-lock-digital-keypad-gun-storage-cabinet-with-built-in-sto-1/public"/></a></div>

My journey with the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe has been quite eventful. As a first-time gun owner, I was initially excited about the prospect of owning a solid gun cabinet that not only secures my beloved firearms, but also offers a space for document and paperwork storage. However, this excitement was short-lived as the cabinet's material was thin and flimsy, making it difficult to maintain its upright position without additional support, which wasn't great for a cabinet designed for heavy-duty firearms.

Nevertheless, the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe did shine in certain areas. The digital keypad allowed for quick access and the cabinet's interior was well-lit, making it easy to locate specific items in low-light conditions. It also came with a removable shelf, allowing for customizable storage configurations based on my needs.

Despite providing decent basic security, the cabinet didn't offer much room for document storage, which turned out to be a major downside. In addition, the cabinet's quality fell short of my expectations, leaving much to be desired in terms of durability and overall build quality.

Overall, while the VEVOR 5 Gun Safe offered some useful features, it was a lackluster experience due to its low-quality material and limited storage capabilities. However, for gun enthusiasts on a budget who prioritize basic firearm security, this cabinet may be worth considering.

### [Fortress 44EF30W Fire and Waterproof Safe](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/portable-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortress-large-174-cu-ft-personal-fire-and-waterproof-safe-with-electronic-lock-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Fortress large personal fire and waterproof safe, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer in securing my valuables. It's fire and waterproof, offering up to 45 minutes of fire protection at 1400 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, it's waterproof for up to 72 hours, making it perfect for storage in basements or near sources of water.

The solid steel construction lends a sturdy feel to the safe and its sturdy, easy-grip lever handle makes it easy to operate. The electronic keypad is easy to set up, allowing me to generate a personal code that I can easily remember but wouldn't be obvious to others. In case I ever forget the code, there are backup keys included in the package.

One of the features that stood out to me is its interior. Completely carpeted, it provides a soft landing not only for my precious items but also for the adjustable shelves that come with it. These provide ample space for organizing my belongings, ensuring I can store as much as possible in this compact safe.

Another highlight is its easy installation process. With pre-drilled mounting holes and the inclusion of mounting hardware, securing the safe to the floor was hassle-free. It gives me added peace of mind knowing that my belongings are not only secure within the safe but also protected from being stolen.

However, one area where the safe could have been improved is the digital lock. While it works perfectly well, its quality doesn't quite match up with the rest of the safe. Additionally, the mounting bolts provided in the package may not be best suited for all types of floors, so some users may need to invest in extra anchors or screws for a secure installation.

In conclusion, the Fortress large personal fire and waterproof safe is a trustworthy companion for safeguarding my valuable items. Its sturdy construction, advanced digital lock, and roomy interior make it a reliable choice for both residential and commercial use. While it does have some minor drawbacks, these are easily overshadowed by its commendable performance in securing my valuables. If you're looking for a safe that balances functionality with price, this one is definitely worth considering.
