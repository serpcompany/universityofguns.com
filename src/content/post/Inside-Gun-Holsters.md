However, there are some minor issues worth mentioning. While the holster material broke in well around my gun, I did feel that the gun could be more securely held within it. The plastic clip on the side also tends to lose its retention strength over time.

Nevertheless, overall, I am very happy with my purchase. The Galco Stow-N-Go Inside The Pant Holster offers a comfortable, secure, and inconspicuous concealed carry option, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in the market for a new holster.

Anecdote:

Considerations:

While the Galco Stow-N-Go Inside The Pant Holster offers several benefits, it's crucial to remember that it may take some time for the holster to break in and conform to the shape of your specific firearm.
