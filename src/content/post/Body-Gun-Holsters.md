<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-poly80-pf940c-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod1-iwb-kydex-holster-system-custom-right-hand-poly80-pf940c-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to test out the C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB, and it has quickly become one of my favorite holsters. The custom craftsmanship ensures a perfect fit for your specific needs, making it both comfortable and effective in daily use.

One feature I found particularly useful was the Open Bottom design that fits threaded barrels and compensators perfectly. This is something not all holsters can do, so it's a big plus for me. Another great aspect is the Custom Dark Wing, which offers added concealment and helps minimize any printing while carrying my firearm.

In terms of security, the solid locking retention provides a secure hold on my gun with a tactile click when holstered to let you know it's locked in place. This gives me great peace of mind while carrying. Additionally, comfort is a top priority with this holster due to its patent-pending hinge system that conforms to body movements during activities like bending or squatting.

The. 093" thickness combined with precision CNC manufacturing (to within. 003 inches! ) makes for excellent durability with minimal added weight for comfortable all-day carry. Plus, all hardware has an added Salt bath Nitriding treatment for increased strength and rust/corrosion prevention - so you know it can handle whatever comes its way!

I did experience some difficulties installing the extra mag carrier at first but their customer support was quick to respond over email with clear instructions that helped resolve the issue promptly - not enough for me to deduct from my rating or recommendation at all! Overall, if you're looking for a high-quality custom-crafted Kydex IWB holster that delivers on comfort, concealment and security – look no further than C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB!

### [Alien Gear Photon Holster for CZ P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster, and I've been putting it through its paces. This modern, versatile holster is truly ambidextrous and can be configured for both IWB (inside the waistband) and OWB (outside the waistband) use. It's optimized for appendix carry, with an included appendix carry wing for concealment, and it even has an optional sidecar mag carrier.

One of the things I love about the Photon is that it's designed with the modern shooter in mind. It's light bearing capable (compatible with compact lights), and it has an optic cut for any optic except the SRO. Plus, it's made right here in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning. Some users have reported missing or wrong components, which can be quite frustrating when you're ready to use your new holster right away. Additionally, the holster can be quite tight and stiff, making it more difficult to draw the weapon than some other options out there.

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster is a versatile and high-quality option for those looking to carry their P320C or M18. Just be prepared for some potential issues and make sure to double-check the components before you head out.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Mission First Tactical MFT Belly Band Holster. It's comfortable, versatile, and packed with useful features that make it stand out from the competition.

### [RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for Glock 17](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/body-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rangemaxx-shoulder-holster-black-4-5-and-glock-17-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.
