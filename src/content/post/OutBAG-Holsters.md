However, there are some areas that could use improvement in future iterations of this holster model; notably, enhancing its compatibility with optics like HoloSun 507K without compromising holster draw or fitment quality would be great as this was something other brands were able to accomplish successfully. Furthermore, offering wider belt loops for more carrying options would also be a welcome addition.

Despite these minor issues, I still highly recommend this product due to its precision craftsmanship from high-quality materials made right here in America along with top-notch customer service provided by BladeTech's team should you ever need support downline - all of which contribute towards making this Classic OWB Holster truly worthy of consideration no matter what level shooter you might be!

The thumb break and precise molding work together with a tension device for added security while still allowing for a fast draw when needed.
