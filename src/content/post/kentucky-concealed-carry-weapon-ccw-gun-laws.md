Kentucky: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------


Kentucky is a shall-issue, [permitless](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19691) carry state with licenses processed by the State Police. No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. A background check is required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer.


### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Self or a Third Party


The use of physical **force** by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect the person or a third party against the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. The use of **deadly force** by a person is justifiable only when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect himself or a third party against imminent death, serious physical injury, kidnapping, sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat, or other felony involving the use of force.


#### Defense of Dwelling, Residence or Occupied Vehicle


A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm when using deadly force to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry upon such person’s dwelling, residence or occupied vehicle, or an attempt to remove another against that person’s will from the dwelling, residence or occupied vehicle.


#### Protection of Property


The use of physical **force** by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is immediately necessary to prevent:


* The commission of criminal trespass, robbery, burglary or other felony involving the use of force in a dwelling, building or upon real property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts; or
* Theft, criminal mischief or any unlawful taking of tangible, movable property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts.


The use of **deadly force** by a defendant upon another person is justifiable only when the defendant believes that the person against whom such force is used is:


* Attempting to dispossess him or her of the dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession;
* Committing or attempting to commit a burglary, robbery or other felony involving the use of force; or
* Committing or attempting to commit arson of a dwelling or other building in his or her possession.


#### Self-Defense


Kentucky is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.


In terms of reciprocity, Kentucky recognizes all currently valid concealed carry permits issued by other U.S. jurisdictions. Successful completion of a firearms training course that has been state-approved is required to obtain a CCDW license. CCDW licenses are available to residents and military personnel stationed in Kentucky. Licenses are not available for non-residents. A person who uses permitted force is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action, unless the person against whom the force was used is a peace officer. [Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § [503.050](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19669), [503.055](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19670), [503.070](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19672), [503.080](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19673) & [503.085](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=19674)]
