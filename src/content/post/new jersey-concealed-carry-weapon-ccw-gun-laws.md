## New Jersey: Gun Laws Summary

If you're a gun owner in New Jersey, it's important to understand the state's gun laws to avoid any legal issues. In New Jersey, a Firearms Purchaser Identification (FPID) card and a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) conducted through a federally licensed firearms dealer are required to buy a handgun from a private individual. To purchase handgun ammunition from dealers in the state, an FPID is also required. Both dealer purchases and private sales require a copy of the purchase permit to be sent to the New Jersey State Police Firearms Investigations Unit. It's essential to follow these regulations to avoid any legal issues.

### Self-Defense

New Jersey is a Castle Doctrine state, meaning there is no duty to retreat while in a person's dwelling. The use of force is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes it necessary to prevent an attempt to commit theft, criminal mischief, or other criminal interference with the actor's personal property or the possession of another for whose protection he or she acts. The use of force is also justifiable when the actor is in possession or control of premises or is licensed or privileged to be there and reasonably believes such force necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by such other person in or upon such premises.

#### Use of Force Upon or to Protect a Third Person

The actor would be justified in using such force to protect himself or herself against the injury he or she believes to be threatened to the person whom he or she seeks to protect and the person whom the actor seeks to protect would be justified in using such protective force, and the actor reasonably believes that the intervention is necessary for the protection of such other person.

#### Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling

The use of force or deadly force upon or toward an intruder who is unlawfully in a dwelling is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes that the force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself or herself or other persons in the dwelling against the use of unlawful force by the intruder. A reasonable belief exists when the actor, to protect himself or herself or a third person, was in his or her dwelling at the time of the offense or was privileged to be thereon, and the encounter between the actor and intruder was sudden and unexpected, compelling the actor to act instantly.

It's important to note that New Jersey is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons permits issued at the local level by municipal police departments or NJ State Police. Concealed carry is only legal with a NJ Permit to Carry a Handgun (PCH). PCH are issued to residents and non-residents, and a firearms training course is required for new applicants who must be at least 21 years old. In terms of reciprocity, New Jersey does not honor permits from any other states. Open carry is not explicitly prohibited in New Jersey state law, although a NJ Permit to Carry a Handgun (PCH) is required to carry a firearm in the State.

| Do handguns need to be registered in New Jersey?                                                                       | Firearms registration is voluntary, but since handgun purchase permit records are maintained by the New Jersey State Police Firearms Investigation Unit, there is de facto mandatory handgun registration for handguns purchased in state. Firearms which have been legally acquired in another state and are legal to possess in New Jersey may be brought to New Jersey by the owner when residency is established. According to the NJSP Firearms Investigation Unit's website, "the owner may voluntarily register the firearm(s) by completing a Voluntary Form of Firearms Registration [Form S.P. 650], found on this website, however the owner is not obligated to do so."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Are there exceptions?                                                                                                  | Yes. A permit to purchase a handgun and a background check conducted through a federally licensed firearms dealer are required to buy a handgun.  A permit to purchase or a firearms purchaser identification card shall not be required for the passing of a firearm upon the death of an owner thereof to his or her heir or legatee. If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he or she may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for no more 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides.

| Handgun Purchase Process                                                                                               | To purchase a firearm in New Jersey, you must have a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card. This can be obtained by filing an Application For Firearms Purchaser Identification Card / Application To Purchase A Handgun with the New Jersey State Police. The form can be completed and then submitted in person at your local municipal police department or a New Jersey State Police Department that covers your jurisdiction. You may also apply online through the Firearms Applicant Registration System. If you do choose to apply online, you must contact the police department that covers your jurisdiction first and obtain the proper Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) number before starting the application. To complete your application, you will also need to provide a New Jersey driver's license or state-issued ID card and list 2 references who can attest to your good character and sound mental health. In addition to this, you will need to consent to fingerprinting and a criminal and mental health background check. A Consent for Mental Health Records Search Form (SP 66) is required. After your application and consent forms are submitted, the State of New Jersey has 30 days to notify you if you are approved or denied for your Firearms Purchaser Identification Card. If approved, you have 90 days to purchase a handgun before the permit expires. [[NJSP Firearms Investigation Unit](https://nj.gov/njsp/firearms/)] |
