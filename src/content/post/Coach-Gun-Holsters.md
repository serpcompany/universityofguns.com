### [Urban Carry LockLeather OWB Combo Holster with Magazine Pouch](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="lockleather-owbmag-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lockleather-owbmag-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using the Urban Carry LockLeather Combo holster on a daily basis and I must say that its design is both practical and comfortable. The leather is smooth yet tough, allowing it to snugly wrap around my waist without any discomfort or snagging. Despite being well-made, it effectively conceals my firearm so there are no visible bulges or lines under my clothing.

The retention clip is a standout feature, offering unmatched security for my gun while still allowing for quick access when needed. Additionally, the extra magazine holder is very convenient, putting a spare mag within easy reach at all times. My only minor issue with this holster was adjusting the cant angle to fit perfectly with my body type but after some tweaking I managed to get it just right.

Overall, this has been an excellent product choice that offers safety, convenience and style without compromising comfort. While there might be some minor imperfections depending on personal preferences, they are easily resolved and don't take away from the overall quality of the holster. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for an efficient and dependable holster for everyday use.

### [C&G Holsters Covert OWB Belt Holster for S&W CSX, Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-sw-csx-right-hand-black-0638-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cg-holsters-covert-owb-belt-holster-sw-csx-right-hand-black-0638-101/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Smith & Wesson CSX and decided to pair it with C&G's OWB Kydex Holster. The gun fits the holster perfectly and sits high on my belt, making it easy to conceal even when wearing shorter jackets or shirts. The retention is spot on - snug enough to keep the gun secure but not too tight that drawing is difficult.

One of my favorite features is how comfortable the holster is to wear all day. The material conforms well to my body and distributes the weight of the gun evenly, reducing strain and discomfort. Adjusting both retention and cant was a breeze, allowing me to customize it according to my preferences.

Additionally, I was impressed with how quickly C&G shipped this holster out. It arrived in no time at all and has been a reliable companion ever since. If you're looking for a top-quality holster that combines excellent fit, comfort, and adjustability – I highly recommend C&G's OWB Kydex Holster for your Smith & Wesson CSX!

I've been using the Tagua Paddle Holsters as my daily carry for several months now, and I must say that it has lived up to my expectations. The thermal-molded Safari-Laminate construction offers a great balance between protection and ease of access; every time I reach for my weapon, it's exactly where I need it to be.

One thing I particularly appreciate about this holster is its wrap-around design combined with a custom-formed thumb break – it gives me that added peace of mind knowing my firearm is secure while still being easily accessible. The adjustable tensioning device also ensures that my weapon stays snugly in place without any fear of accidental disengagement.

What sets the Tagua Paddle Holsters apart, in my opinion, is their concealed carry capability. It does an exceptional job keeping a low profile and minimizing print when worn under clothing, making it ideal even for plainclothes duties or off-duty carrying. Additionally, the holster rides extremely close to the body which helps me maintain a secure grip on my weapon at all times.

On top of this, SafariSuede on the inside helps protect my firearm from scratches and wear caused by frequent use in various environments and activities. This level of protection is crucial considering how often I rely on this holster during day-to-day tasks and more intense situations alike.

In summary, if you're looking for an efficient and reliable holster that provides excellent gun retention capabilities while remaining easily accessible when needed most, then the Tagua Paddle Holsters are definitely worth considering.

### [DeSantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 - Black Right Hand](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/desantis-die-hard-ankle-rig-for-glock-43-black-right-hand-1/public"/></a></div>

As an avid gun enthusiast, I've tried quite a few holsters over the years, but the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for my Glock 43 has definitely been a game-changer. It's worn on the inside of your ankle opposite to which hand you will draw your firearm with, which initially took a bit of getting used to. But once I broke it in, it felt incredibly comfortable.

The top-grain saddle leather and a super tough PU coating ensure the longevity and performance of this rig, making it perfect for everyday use or deep concealment. The smooth leather lining not only protects the gun's finish but also offers a quick draw - a feature that I absolutely love about this ankle rig.

One of the standout features of this holster is the neoprene leg band, which is both padded with foam and lined with sheepskin. This combination provides incredible comfort and ensures that the holster stays in place even during long hours of wear.

However, there's always room for improvement. Some users may feel that the leg band is a bit too short or that the strap should be reversed. I too experienced some initial discomfort and adjustments in tightness and positioning helped make it more comfortable over time.

Concealment-wise, I think this product does its job rather well. However, I would recommend wearing bigger pants or boot-cut pants to provide better coverage and concealment for those who are conscious about their firearm being visible.

Overall, the Desantis Die Hard Ankle Rig for Glock 43 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and reliable ankle holster. Its high-quality materials and precise craftsmanship make it perfect for daily use or deep concealment situations. Although there are minor cons to this product, they are easily overshadowed by the benefits it provides.

### [Crucial Concealment Covert Sig P365 X-MACRO IWB Holster](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crucial-concealment-covert-iwb-holster-sig-p365-x-macro-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently been using the "Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO" in my day-to-day routine and must say it's been quite an experience. The minimalistic design isn't just for show, it really does deliver on its promise of effective concealment without sacrificing comfort.

One of the standout features for me was the trigger bump. It added an extra layer of safety without being intrusive or uncomfortable, which is quite impressive. Plus, the fully adjustable cant and adjustable retention make it perfect for anyone, regardless of their preferences. Another thing that really caught my attention is how compatible it is with optics, making it a versatile choice for those looking to upgrade their gear.

However, there are some things that could be improved. While the holster material, kydex, is durable and reliable, it might not suit everyone's taste due to its hard and rigid nature. Additionally, some people might find the black color too plain and boring, but then again, that's mostly down to personal preferences.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient inside-the-waistband holster that offers solid concealment capabilities, the Covert IWB Holster Sig P365 X-MACRO would be a great choice.

### [7360RDS Safariland 7TS ALS/SLS Mid-Ride Red Dot Optics Holster for Duty](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/coach-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

The holster's durability is impressive, especially given its lightweight nature. The construction from SafariSeven material is designed to withstand harsh elements and even prolonged submergence in water, guaranteeing the longevity of my investment. Moreover, it's gentle on the weapon's finish and prevents dirt and moisture from damaging my firearm.

The adjustable mid-ride belt loop allows for a comfortable fit, with the holster nestling snugly against my body. It's compatible with all Safariland holster mounting options, providing flexibility in how I carry it.

However, one downside is the adjustment process. It requires a learning curve and can be a bit tricky initially, especially for those new to this type of holster.
