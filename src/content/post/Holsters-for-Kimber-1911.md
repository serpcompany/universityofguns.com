The holster's adjustable retention screws allow me to fine-tune the fit and security level of my firearm, giving me peace of mind when it's holstered. The modular mounting holes also provide a great level of versatility, allowing me to customize the draw and ride of my holster according to my preferences or specific situations.

One feature that stands out is the optic-ready speed cut design, which ensures a smooth and reliable draw every time. This aspect is particularly helpful in competition settings where quick draws are crucial. Additionally, the positive lock trigger guard system provides tactile feedback, assuring me that my firearm is securely stored at all times, whether I'm competing or carrying for personal protection.

It's important to note that some users have reported issues with adjusting the screws on their holsters due to them spinning without catching the post beneath.
