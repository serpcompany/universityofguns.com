District of Columbia: Gun Laws Summary
--------------------------------------


Washington, D.C. is a shall-issue district with concealed weapons licenses issued by D.C. Metropolitan Police.


All firearms must be registered, and this process acts as a permit to purchase. Individuals cannot possess ammunition without a valid registration of a firearm.


Open carry is illegal in D.C.


District of Columbia Concealed Carry Pistol Licenses (CCPLs) are required in order to concealed carry and are issued to residents and non-residents and require a firearms training course that has been approved by the Metro Police. You must be at least 21 years old to get a concealed carry license in D.C. Any firearm you plan on carrying in Washington D.C. will also need to be registered in the District. In addition, possession of ammunition for an unregistered firearm is prohibited in the District of Columbia. Some areas are off-limits even with a D.C. CCPL, including schools, public memorials on the National Mall and along the Tidal Basin and the area around the White House. In terms of reciprocity, Washington D.C. does not honor CCW licenses from any other state.


### Self-Defense


Under the case law of the District of Columbia, the District is neither a “stand your ground” nor a “duty to retreat” jurisdiction. The District case law has established a middle ground.


Based on case law and jury instructions, you are entitled to claim self-defense:


* If you actually believe you are in imminent danger of bodily harm; and
* If you have reasonable grounds for that belief.


You may use the amount of [force](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/7/chapters/25/subchapters/I/) which, at the time of the incident, you actually and reasonably believe is necessary to protect yourself (or a third person) from imminent bodily harm. This may extend to the use of [deadly force](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/7/chapters/25/subchapters/I/) if you actually and reasonably believe you are in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm from which you can save yourself only by using deadly force against your assailant. You should take reasonable steps, such as stepping back or walking away, to avoid the necessity of taking a human life, so long as those steps are consistent with your own safety. [You do not have to retreat or consider retreating](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/titles/7/chapters/25/subchapters/I/) when you actually and reasonably believe that you are in danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force is necessary to repel that danger. Generally, you may not use deadly force to protect your property.

The term “large capacity ammunition feeding device” means a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip or similar device that has a capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The term “large capacity ammunition feeding device” shall not include an attached tubular device designed to accept, and capable of operating only with, .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. [[D.C.

| Possession/Carry of Handgun in Home without License | In order for an individual to possess a firearm in their home or place of business, the firearm must first be registered with the D.C. Metro Police Department. In addition, a registration permit does not allow someone to take a firearm outside of those two locations. [**[D,C. Code § 22–4504.01](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-4504.01.html)**] |
| Permit Required to Purchase Handgun | Yes. The firearms registration process also serves as a permitting process. |
| Background Checks Required for Private Gun Sales | Yes. Private party firearms transfers must be conducted through a licensed dealer, who is required by federal law to perform a background check and keep a record of the sale. [[D.C. Code § 7–2502.01](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/7-2502.01.html)] |

| Waiting Period after Purchasing Handgun | Yes. There is a 10-day waiting period. |
| Handguns Need to be Registered | Yes. All firearms must be registered with the Metropolitan Police Department. A background check and online training are required. |
| List of Approved Handguns for Registration | The Metropolitan Police Department maintains a roster of "handguns not determined to be unsafe" that includes the approved handgun rosters from California, Maryland and Massachusetts. Handguns with superficial differences from handguns on the roster – such as color or grip material – can be registered. Handguns that are removed from the California list for administrative reasons remain on the District list. [[Firearms Eligible for Registration​](https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/1284986)] |
| Handgun Purchase/Registration Process | If you purchase a firearm in the District of Columbia or move to the District of Columbia with a firearm, you must register your firearm with the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). This process must be completed before a licensed dealer is legally allowed to release a firearm to you after a purchase. All firearms sales, including private sales, must be conducted through a licensed dealer. Not all firearms are eligible for registration or legal to own in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia utilizes firearms lists approved by the states of California, Massachusetts and Maryland. A firearm does not need to be found on all three lists in order to be eligible for registration in the District. The MPD website includes a complete [list of approved firearms](https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/1284986). To register a firearm in the District of Columbia an individual must complete a Firearms Statement of Eligibility Form. You will turn in this form along with an Application for Firearms Registration Certificate Form at the time that you apply for registration. Note that both the seller and the purchaser must complete portions of the Firearms Registration Certificate Form. Both forms can be found on the [MPD website](https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/firearm-registration-district-columbia). An individual must also obtain a certificate of completion from a free, 30-minute [online Firearms Safety Training Course](https://dcfst.mpdconline.com/) through the Metropolitan Police Department. This requirement may also be fulfilled by providing evidence that the applicant has received firearms training in the U.S. Military or if the applicant possesses a license or permit from a state with similar or stricter education requirements. Completed applications must be brought in person to the Metropolitan Police Department - Firearms Regulation Section along with a photo ID, proof of residency in the District of Columbia and proof that you have met the MPD’s education and training requirements. Next, you must pay the application fee and submit to fingerprinting for a background check. Your application will either be approved or denied within five business days. You must then bring your certificate of registration to the licensed dealer, who will release the firearm to you no sooner than ten days after the initial purchase was made. |
