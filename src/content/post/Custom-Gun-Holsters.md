I've been using the Vedder Holsters Quick Draw OWB Holster for a few weeks now and it's been quite the adventure. The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and high-quality craftsmanship. The combination of premium leather and molded Kydex creates a perfect fit for my firearm, making it incredibly comfortable to carry.

One of the standout features for me has been the adjustable cant angle, allowing me to position my firearm at just the right angle for quick and efficient draws. Additionally, the holster's retention system ensures that my gun stays securely in place, even during strenuous activities.

However, there are a few drawbacks to this holster. The rough spot on the polymer lining has scratched my pistol, which is quite disappointing considering the price I paid. Furthermore, the extended leather on the bottom can be quite uncomfortable when sitting for prolonged periods.

In conclusion, the Vedder Holsters Quick Draw OWB Holster delivers on its promise of a comfortable, well-fitting holster but could benefit from some minor improvements.
