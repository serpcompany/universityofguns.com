## Reviews

### [Self-Healing Pigeon Perch Target Holder for Rifles, Handguns, BB, and Pellet Guns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="do-all-pigeon-perch-clay-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-pigeon-perch-clay-target-1/public"/></a></div>

The Do-All Outdoors Pigeon Perch target holder is a reliable and durable option for shooting practice. Constructed with advanced Impact Seal material, it can self-heal after a bullet passes through, allowing for hours of continuous use without significant damage. This target holder can withstand all calibers of both rifles and handguns, as well as BB and pellet guns. Its ability to grip clays even when hit off center ensures multiple shots before replacement is needed. However, removing shattered clay pieces from the seals may be time-consuming at times, and the metal bar might not hold up against hard hits or misfires from high caliber bullets like. 308s. Overall, the product offers good entertainment value along with solid construction quality for extended usage periods – an affordable option that delivers on durability while maintaining safety protocols during handling weapons.

### [High-Speed Crossbow Field Point Target with Carry Handle](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="morrell-yj-350-jacket-field-point-target-yellow-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/morrell-yj-350-jacket-field-point-target-yellow-1/public"/></a></div>

The Morrell Archery Targets are robust and reliable with their multi-layered density design and X-tended life technology. Their innovative engineering can withstand field point bolts fired by high-speed crossbows, which makes them ideal for me since I practice with my crossbow. The carrying handle allows portability and convenience while the multiple bull's-eyes help me track my progress.

The target is 100% waterproof, so I don't worry about rain interfering with its performance. One unique feature of this product is how easily arrows can be removed even after being shot at high speeds, saving me valuable time during my practice sessions.

However, it's important to note that these targets may not be as suitable for low poundage bows or recurve bows as they are specifically designed for use with high-speed crossbows. Additionally, the price might be considered on the higher side when compared to other similar products like Glendel Buck Targets or Field Logic Targets but it does provide good value for money due to its durability and long lifespan.

Overall, the Morrell Archery Targets offer exceptional performance and sturdiness for anyone looking to improve their archery skills using a powerful crossbow while also providing convenience in terms of transportation and ease of arrow removal

### [13-Target Reversible Cardboard Shooting Range Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="reversa-corrugated-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/reversa-corrugated-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently discovered the ReVersa premium quality corrugated target, and I must say it has become my go-to choice for shooting practice. The front of the target features 13 clear targets with ample spacing, making it easy to aim at from a distance. Not only does the backside accommodate up to 12 clay pigeons, but it also serves as a sturdy backer for other targets.

One of this product's strong points is its speedy setup; when combined with the ReVersa stands, you can have it ready to use in seconds! However, a potential drawback is that covering old holes with tape can be challenging - which limits its lifespan to roughly 3-5 uses based on round count.

Despite this minor issue, I still highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an efficient and versatile target option that doesn't compromise on quality or durability.

### [Magnetic Lacrosse Shooting Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="top-shelf-targets-super-sniper-magnetic-shooting-targets-6-4-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/top-shelf-targets-super-sniper-magnetic-shooting-targets-6-4-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Top Shelf Super Sniper 6-inch shooting targets, and I must say they've been a game-changer in my training sessions. These targets are ingeniously designed to attach magnetically to any metal goal, making setup and teardown incredibly easy. I especially appreciate the all-ages appeal of these targets; even beginners can enjoy the challenge and see improvements in their shooting accuracy.

The highlights of this product are its sturdy construction, innovative magnet design, and inclusive appeal. It's worth mentioning that in recent tests, players experienced a 28.3% increase in shooting accuracy within just three weeks using these targets. I was pleasantly surprised by how well these targets held up, even during shooting drills in freezing weather.

However, there are some drawbacks to this product. The neodymium magnets, while powerful, don't seem to be strong enough to withstand particularly ferocious shots or the impact of hitting the post or crossbar. In these cases, the targets tend to fall off the net, which can disrupt the flow of training sessions. Additionally, although the 6-inch size presents a nice challenge, some users may prefer bigger targets for more visibility and scoring opportunities.

In summary, if you're in the market for a fun and effective way to improve your shooting accuracy, the Top Shelf Super Sniper 6-inch shooting targets are definitely worth considering. Just be prepared for occasional interruptions due to weaker-than-expected magnets and consider adding target tethers to maintain the challenge and keep the practice sessions going strong.

### [DELTA MCKENZIE ShotBlocker Archery Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="delta-sports-products-llc-20890-travel-archery-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-sports-products-llc-20890-travel-archery-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the DELTA SPORTS PRODUCTS LLC 20890 Travel Archery Target and it has quickly become a staple in my hunting practice routine. As a passionate hunter, I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and accuracy, and this target has been instrumental in helping me do just that.

One of the standout features of this target is its easy arrow removal. Unlike some other targets I've used in the past, this one doesn't require a lot of force or effort to remove the arrow, which makes for a quicker and more efficient practice session.

Another feature that has impressed me is the built-in carrying handle, which makes it incredibly easy to transport the target from one location to another. Whether I'm setting up for a practice session in my backyard or taking it with me on a hunting trip, this target is easy to move around and set up.

However, there are a few downsides to this target that are worth mentioning. Some users have reported that the foam layers can start to fall apart after a lot of use, which can affect its overall durability. Additionally, the target does have a weight limit of 280 FPS, so it may not be the best option for those with high-powered bows.

Overall, I would highly recommend the DELTA SPORTS PRODUCTS LLC 20890 Travel Archery Target for anyone looking for a reliable and easy-to-use target for their practice sessions. While it may not be perfect, its combination of features and ease of use make it a great option for hunters of all skill levels.

### [VisiColor Multi-Color Hunting Targets](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="champion-visicolor-deer-targets-10-pack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/champion-visicolor-deer-targets-10-pack-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Visicolor Deer Targets (10 Pack) by Champion for my practice sessions and I must say, they've made hunting range gear so much more enjoyable. The first thing that caught my eye was its high-visibility feature - a simple yet effective way to identify specific hit locations. I particularly liked the multiple color options provided by VisiShot technology, which made sighting-in a piece of cake.

Another aspect that stood out was their robustness. Being made from high-quality materials, these targets have withstood harsh weather conditions without fading or tearing. Their size allows for long-range shooting practice from 100-200 yards, making them perfect for hunters looking to improve their skills.

However, one minor drawback I noticed was that the colors can fade after prolonged use, especially if exposed to direct sunlight. But considering the overall performance, it's a small price to pay for such an interactive and fun practice tool.

In short, if you're serious about enhancing your shooting skills or just looking for some entertaining practice session, the Visicolor Deer Targets (10 Pack) is definitely worth considering.

### [Realistic 3D Deer Target for Hunting Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/hunting-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="delta-mckenzie-challenger-3d-deer-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-mckenzie-challenger-3d-deer-target-1/public"/></a></div>

The McKenzie Challenger 3D Deer Target has been my faithful companion in my backyard archery practice sessions. This lifelike deer target boasts a replaceable vital and self-healing foam technology, making it not just visually appealing but also functional. Easy arrow removal is another feature that I truly appreciate.

One of the significant highlights is the product's build quality. It's designed to withstand hours of continuous shooting, offering an authentic hunting experience. Another positive aspect worth mentioning is its resilience against various types of arrows, including broadhead, expandable, and field tip arrows.

However, there are a few drawbacks worth considering. Firstly, some users report difficulty removing arrows from the plastic legs, which can lead to damaging the arrow or the target. Secondly, while the self-healing foam works well to some extent, it may not be as robust or efficient as advertised.

All things considered, the McKenzie Challenger 3D Deer Target delivers on its promise of providing a realistic shooting experience, making it a worthwhile investment for avid archers and bowhunters. But remember, practice makes perfect, and this target is sure to keep you busy until you get that perfect shot.
