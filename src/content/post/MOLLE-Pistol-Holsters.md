I recently had the chance to test out the C&G Holsters Mod 1 Kydex IWB, and it has quickly become one of my favorite holsters. The custom craftsmanship ensures a perfect fit for your specific needs, making it both comfortable and effective in daily use.

One feature I found particularly useful was the Open Bottom design that fits threaded barrels and compensators perfectly. This is something not all holsters can do, so it's a big plus for me. Another great aspect is the Custom Dark Wing, which offers added concealment and helps minimize any printing while carrying my firearm.

In terms of security, the solid locking retention provides a secure hold on my gun with a tactile click when holstered to let you know it's locked in place. This gives me great peace of mind while carrying. Additionally, comfort is a top priority with this holster due to its patent-pending hinge system that conforms to body movements during activities like bending or squatting.

The. 093" thickness combined with precision CNC manufacturing (to within. 003 inches! ) makes for excellent durability with minimal added weight for comfortable all-day carry. Plus, all hardware has an added Salt bath Nitriding treatment for increased strength and rust/corrosion prevention - so you know it can handle whatever comes its way!
