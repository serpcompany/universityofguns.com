I recently purchased the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster for use with my Glock 17 and I couldn't be happier. This holster is fully adjustable and the padding provides excellent protection for my firearm. The design was thoughtfully engineered to make it comfortable and easy to wear, even for extended periods of time.

One of my favorite features is the ability to adjust both the harness and tiedowns for a customized fit. This versatility ensures that the holster stays securely in place no matter what I'm doing. Another great feature is the adjustable tie-down that keeps the firearm from moving around, which is essential for ensuring a smooth draw when needed.

However, there are definitely some drawbacks to this holster. While the padding is comfortable, it also adds extra bulk that can make it difficult to carry the holster discreetly when necessary. Additionally, I noticed that it took me a few uses to get a hang of adjusting the various straps and tie-downs for the perfect fit. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer included some basic instructions to help with that process.

All in all, the RangeMaxx Shoulder Gun Holster is a well-designed and comfortable option for those in need of a reliable shoulder holster. With some minor improvements, it could be a truly exceptional product.
