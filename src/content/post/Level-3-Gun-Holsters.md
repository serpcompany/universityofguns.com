I have been using this holster for my Sig Sauer P250 9mm and P320 9mm for quite some time now, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in terms of security and comfort. The ALS (Automatic Locking System) is a standout feature as it secures the weapon once holstered, providing instant Level II retention. If I need an extra layer of safety, rotating the hood back gives me Level III retention. This ensures that my gun remains secure no matter what situation I find myself in.

Another great aspect of this product is its Sentinel option, which offers additional security with an optional Sentry installed. This gives me peace of mind knowing that my weapon is safe at all times. The simple design also allows for a smooth straight up draw once all releases are deactivated, making it easy to access my weapon when needed. Additionally, the holster's slim construction enables it to ride close to my body without being bulky or uncomfortable.

Overall, this holster has performed exceptionally well and has become an essential part of my daily carry routine due to its top-notch safety features and ease of use. While there have been instances where I wished the draw was even smoother, it's not enough to deter from the overall satisfaction with the product.

The overall design of this holster is quite appealing. It's made from durable material that not only protects my weapon but also maintains a sleek appearance, allowing for minimal bulkiness under clothing. The lining within the holster is not only low-friction for easy draws but also sound-dampening, perfect for stealth operations.

However, there's one issue worth mentioning. While the Level 3 Retention strap across the back of the slide does add extra security, it can sometimes make inserting your weapon a little tricky. Despite this minor inconvenience, the holster is still incredibly user-friendly, even for beginners.

In conclusion, the T-Series L3D Light-Bearing Duty Holster is a reliable and efficient choice for those looking for a secure, high-performing holster.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-291-492" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-6360-als-sls-level-iii-mid-ride-retention-holster-6360-291-492/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has used the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster for my everyday carry, I can attest to its sturdy construction and exceptional level of retention. The automatic locking system ensures my weapon stays securely in place once it's holstered, while the self-locking system provides an extra layer of protection with its rotating hood.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the slim, compact design that allows my weapon to ride close to my body. This not only ensures optimal concealment but also provides a comfortable and ergonomic fit. Additionally, the smooth, straight up draw after deactivating all releases has become second nature to me, making the holster incredibly user-friendly.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the holster initially feels quite stiff and may require some "breaking in" before it provides a seamless draw. Secondly, the plastic construction might make it slightly more challenging to draw with your non-dominant hand compared to leather holsters, although this improves with practice.

Overall, the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster has exceeded my expectations and has become an indispensable part of my carry setup. Its high level of retention and user-friendly features make it an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and secure holster for their firearm.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/level-3-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="safariland-model-6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safariland-model-6360-als-sls-mid-ride-level-iii-retention-duty-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

In my day-to-day life, one of the most essential items I've come to rely on is the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster. This level III retention holster has changed the game for me when it comes to safety, comfort, and convenience.

One of the features that truly sets this holster apart is its ALS and SLS systems. The ALS, or Automatic Locking System, secures the weapon when it's holstered, while the SLS, or Self Locking System, adds an extra layer of security. Together, they provide exceptional protection and a straightforward, consistent draw.

Another aspect I love about this holster is its slim and compact design. It allows the weapon to ride close to the body, making it feel more secure and comfortable when I'm wearing it. Additionally, the mid-ride belt loop enables it to protect the weapon well while still making it easy and quick to draw.

Practicing with the holster is essential, especially considering the complex nature of some of its components. However, with time and repetition, these features have become second nature, enabling a smoother and quicker draw.

The durability and construction of this holster are also noteworthy. The Safari Laminate construction with a leather look finish provides a long-lasting and reliable product. I've had various Safariland holsters throughout the years, and they've all performed admirably.

However, I've encountered some challenges with this holster. The plastic construction, for instance, tends to fight against the light more than other models I've used in the past. Additionally, drawing with my non-gun hand is more difficult with this holster compared to others I've tried.

Overall, I have no major concerns about the Safariland Model 6360 ALS/SLS Mid-Ride holster. It's a reliable, functional, and high-quality product that has made a significant difference in my day-to-day life.
