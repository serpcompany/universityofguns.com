### [High-Capacity 32 Gun Safe with Electronic Lock](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="stealth-pr32-premier-32-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stealth-pr32-premier-32-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Stealth PR32 Premier 32 Gun Safe and I must say, it's a game changer! This sleek black safe has a heavy duty 10-gauge steel body and an impressive 90-minute fire rating to keep my valuables safe. The customizable door panel organizer is an absolute lifesaver, allowing me to store up to 32 guns. Plus, with the pre-installed interior power and leather-lined shelving, it's a breeze to organize my collection.

The craftsmanship of this safe is top-notch. Every detail feels thoughtfully designed, from the thick 1/4" steel plate door to the smooth-turning electronic keypad lock. Even the visual appeal of the product is hard to resist.

However, one thing that could be improved is the weight of the safe. At 550 pounds, it's quite bulky and tough to move around. But hey, that's the price of high-quality security, right?

All in all, if you're in the market for a reliable, secure, and organised gun safe, look no further than the Stealth PR32 Premier 32 Gun Safe. You won't regret it!

### [Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock 24-Gun Safe by Liberty in White Gloss](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-ambassador-e-lock-gun-safe-by-liberty-white-gloss-1/public"/></a></div>

I never knew how much I needed a good gun safe until I got my hands on the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty. This safe is a solid piece of work, made from 11-gauge steel. It's like a fortress for myguns! And I appreciate the fire protection it offers; I hope I never need to use it, but it's comforting to have.

The Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe is a perfect combination of style and function. The white gloss finish gives it a sleek, modern look that fits seamlessly into any home. Plus, the pin-dot velour interior provides a soft, cushioned space for my precious firearms, keeping them in pristine condition.

One feature that really stands out is the UL-listed ProLogic SecuRam lock. It's not just secure - it's incredibly easy to use. The custom combo options make it super convenient for me to access my guns when I need them.

However, one downside is the weight. At 1,130 lbs, it's not exactly portable. But hey, that's what you get for a safe that can protect your possessions for 90 minutes at 1,200F!

All in all, the Cabela's Ambassador E-Lock Gun Safe by Liberty has been a game-changer for me. Not only does it keep my guns secure, but it also adds a touch of class to my home. If you're in the market for a high-quality gun safe, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a shot.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-black-cherry-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-insignia-series-fire-rated-60-gun-safe-black-cherry-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe in my home. This safe has some impressive features that make it stand out from others in its category. First off, the 12-gauge industrial steel construction provides a sturdy and secure home for up to 60 long guns and 8 handguns, with a quick-access door pocket for another long gun. The SecuRam UL-Rated electronic lock is a nice touch, offering easy programming and resistance to EMP attacks.

One of the highlights for me was the interior. The built-in LED lighting and fully carpeted shelves make it incredibly easy to navigate my collection in low-light conditions. Plus, the adjustable shelves allow me to customize the storage to suit my specific needs.

However, there are a few cons to consider. For one, the positioning of the motion sensor can be a bit frustrating, as it turns off the LED lights if you're not actively moving your hands in front of it. Additionally, the keypad does not light up, making it difficult to access the safe in the dark.

All in all, the Sports Afield Insignia Series Fire-Rated 60-Gun Safe offers great protection and craftsmanship for anyone looking to secure their firearms. While there are a few minor issues to be aware of, the overall quality and durability make it worth considering for your home security needs.

### [High Quality 23 Gun Safe with Fire Rating](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="stealth-pr23-premier-23-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stealth-pr23-premier-23-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I've recently been using the Stealth PR23 Premier Gun Safe, and I must say it's been a game-changer. It's my go-to safe for securely storing up to 23 of my valuable firearms. I particularly love the customizable door panel organizer where I can store all my ammo and accessories.

The build quality is top-notch with a thick ¼” steel door and even more sturdy 10-gauge steel body. It gives a real sense of security and peace of mind knowing my valuables are protected. Plus, it's got a pretty impressive 90-minute fire rating.

One thing I'm not too crazy about, though, is the slight weight of the safe, but hey, you can't have everything, right?

Overall, I’m extremely happy with my purchase and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Stealth PR23 Premier Gun Safe to anyone looking for a high-quality, secure gun safe.

### [Durable Gun Safe for Rifles and Handguns](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/rural-king-gun-safes?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="sports-afield-sa7240p-preserve-gun-safe-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sports-afield-sa7240p-preserve-gun-safe-1/public"/></a></div>

I own a Sports Afield Preserve Series SA7240P gun safe, and it has been a game-changer for me. With the capacity to hold up to 60 long guns and 8 handguns, I can store my whole collection safely and securely in one place. The configurable interior is easy to adapt for any type of valuables, and the door organizer maximizes storage.

One of the standout features of this safe is the Zero-Sag, steel reinforced top shelf. This shelf adds to the safe's flexibility, allowing even heavier items to be stored at eye level. The electronic lock comes with an Easy Touch keypad that is fully programmable, making access quick and easy.

The interior is fully carpeted, with sidewalls, shelves, and barrel rests providing a uniform appearance and protecting against scratches. The SA7240P also includes a UL-approved power outlet and 4 pre-cut anchor holes with a bolt-down kit and waterproof washers.

In my experience, the safe is built with excellent craftsmanship and can withstand harsh weather conditions. The sturdiness of the SA7240P provides peace of mind knowing that my valuables are protected.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this product. The capacity it claims is possible only if the rifles are stacked tightly, which might not suit everyone. Additionally, the delivery service might not always handle the product with care, as one of the buyers reported.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sports Afield Preserve Series SA7240P gun safe for its ample storage, top-notch craftsmanship, and robust protection. If you're looking for a reliable and secure way to store your firearms and other valuable possessions, this is the perfect choice.
