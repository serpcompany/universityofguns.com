### [Alien Gear Photon Holster for CZ P320C/M18](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-photon-g48-mos-wlight-holster-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster, and I've been putting it through its paces. This modern, versatile holster is truly ambidextrous and can be configured for both IWB (inside the waistband) and OWB (outside the waistband) use. It's optimized for appendix carry, with an included appendix carry wing for concealment, and it even has an optional sidecar mag carrier.

One of the things I love about the Photon is that it's designed with the modern shooter in mind. It's light bearing capable (compatible with compact lights), and it has an optic cut for any optic except the SRO. Plus, it's made right here in the USA and comes with a lifetime warranty.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning. Some users have reported missing or wrong components, which can be quite frustrating when you're ready to use your new holster right away. Additionally, the holster can be quite tight and stiff, making it more difficult to draw the weapon than some other options out there.

Overall, the Alien Gear Photon P320C/M18 holster is a versatile and high-quality option for those looking to carry their P320C or M18. Just be prepared for some potential issues and make sure to double-check the components before you head out.

### [Alien Gear Roswell IWB Holster for Concealed Carry](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/alienware-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-roswell-iwb-holster-riw-0759-r1-rh-150-d-1/public"/></a></div>

When I first got my hands on the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster, I was excited to try it out. This holster is designed for concealed carry, which is perfect for my everyday safety needs. The injection-molded shell sets it apart from traditional Kydex, offering a hard and durable case for my firearm.

One of the standout features of this holster is its versatility. It's suitable for several carrying positions, including strong-side carry and appendix carry. Additionally, the canted grip angle can be adjusted to your preference. Plus, the ride height on your belt is customizable too, allowing you to find the perfect balance between concealment and accessibility.

However, this holster does have its drawbacks. After using it for a while, I found that the carry claw and muzzle wedge, while included, didn't offer much improvement in terms of comfort or concealment. The holster is made in the USA, which is a positive point, but it's not enough to compensate for these issues.

Overall, while the Alien Gear Holsters Roswell IWB Holster does offer a few good things like adjustability and durability, the issues with fit and clearance make it a less-than-ideal choice for me. I'd recommend looking into other options if you're in the market for a new holster.

One feature that I appreciate is the customizable passive retention system. It allows me to adjust the tension on my weapon, ensuring that it stays put no matter the situation. Additionally, the optional finger and thumb releases make it easy to draw my firearm quickly and efficiently when needed.

However, there are a few cons to consider with this holster. Some users, including myself, have found that it tends to ride high on the waistband, which can cause some discomfort during extended periods of wear. Furthermore, the single mounting point may not provide the optimal fit for everyone, as our body shapes and sizes vary significantly.

In conclusion, the Alien Gear ShapeShift Appendix Carry Holster is a high-quality and versatile option for those seeking a comfortable and secure everyday carry solution.

One of the highlights for me is its ambidextrous configuration. Whether I'm wearing it as an inside-the-waistband (IWB) or outside-the-waistband (OWB), this holster adapts seamlessly. It's optimized for appendix carry, which is my preferred method of concealed carry, and it even comes with an appendix carry wing for extra concealment.

Another feature that I appreciate is the holster's compatibility with compact lights. As someone who often trains in low-light conditions, this is a must-have feature for me. Additionally, the optic cut accommodates most optics except for the SRO, making it versatile for various gun setups.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The belt clips and hardware were missing from my package, making the holster unusable until I can get those components.

Alien Gear's Photon holster was a game-changer in my daily life.

The Photon's rugged construction was evident from its very sturdy and heavy-duty feel. Its injection-molded polymer design gives it the perfect blend of toughness and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for those who want something reliable yet comfortable to carry. The option of attaching various sights and scopes to the holster was an added advantage that I appreciated while target shooting.

However, the photon's size and weight did take some getting used to. Although it provides excellent retention and concealment, the bulkiness of the holster, especially when worn IWB, can sometimes be discomforting, especially during prolonged usage. Also, the configuration of the claw and clip makes it a bit challenging to secure the holster onto your waistband without catching your pants on it.

Despite these minor inconveniences, I generally find the Alien Gear Photon holster a worthy investment. Its rugged construction, adaptability, and versatility make it a dependable accessory for gun enthusiasts. However, it may not be the perfect fit for everyone, especially those who prioritize comfort over other features.

However, there were some cons to consider with the Roswell IWB Holster. Firstly, the holster doesn't fit P365XL/MRDS as advertised. This was disappointing, as I had specifically chosen this holster based on the claims made regarding its compatibility with these models.

It's kind of like Lego for grown-ups, but with more serious applications!

To accompany this versatile holster, the Core Carry Pack also comes with a bonus Holster Mount which allows me to attach my ShapeShift onto a variety of surfaces within seconds. This is perfect for those days when I need to switch between carrying my gun and not - less hassle, more convenience.

However, it's not all sunshine and roses. The only drawback I experienced with this product was its size. I found the OWB holster to be quite bulky, making it a bit impractical for casual, everyday use. It definitely felt more suitable for professionals like security personnel or law enforcement officers who need to carry their weapons concealed at all times.

Moreover, while the concept of having adjustable retention is a brilliant idea in theory, it can be a bit confusing for users who are new to modular holsters. The thumb release on the holster could also use some improvement as it tends to get stuck occasionally.

Overall, despite these minor issues, I am quite satisfied with my ShapeShift. It offers great flexibility and convenience, making it easy for me to switch between different carrying styles depending on my mood or outfit for the day. For anyone looking to invest in a high-quality modular holster system, I would definitely recommend giving the Alien Gear ShapeShift Core Carry Pack a shot!
