### [Realistic AR500 Coyote Steel Target for Pest Control Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="cts-targets-ar500-steel-coyote-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cts-targets-ar500-steel-coyote-target-1/public"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I recently tested the CTS Targets Coyote Target for pest control practice. Its realistic 40 x 22-inch size makes it suitable for both close-range and long-range shooting. Constructed from thick AR500 steel, this target can withstand continuous use without showing damage signs.

The two carriage bolt holes allow easy hanging during practice sessions, and its weight of 36. 5 lbs ensures stability when shot from various angles. One of my favorite features is the deep "gong" sound that indicates an accurate hit, helping to hone your aim correctly!

However, compared to other targets on the market, this one is quite expensive. Nevertheless, given its solid construction and durability over time, it's worth investing in if you take pest control seriously. In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and high-quality steel target for pest control practice, consider trying out the CTS Targets Coyote Target!

### [Gallery .22 Resetting Target for Fun Shooting Practice](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-gallery-22-rimfire-resetting-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-gallery-22-rimfire-resetting-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gallery. 22 Resetting Target and have had countless hours of fun shooting it at 25 yards with my. 22 caliber rifle. The reset mechanism works flawlessly, saving me the hassle of walking downrange after each shot.

The construction of this rimfire target is robust and made entirely of solid metal, which gives me confidence in its durability and longevity. The targets hang smoothly and provide a satisfying 'bang' when hit, allowing me to keep track of my shots effortlessly. One useful tip is to lean the target slightly forward for the swing arm targets to rotate back and stay in place when struck – this took some adjusting but worked well once set up.

However, I did notice that the paper stickers on the targets tend to peel off or fade quickly with usage. An easy fix was spray painting them with white paint, making them much more visible at longer distances too. One interesting feature I discovered was that you can reverse the design by simply turning around the target if any rounding occurs due to years of use!

Overall, this rimfire target is an excellent value for its price and provides endless entertainment during plinking sessions with friends or family members who also share a passion for shooting sports. Highly recommended product for anyone looking for an enjoyable addition to their range routine!

### [Birchwood Casey 1/2" IPSC Silhouette Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="birchwood-casey-66-ipsc-silhouette-target-1-2-nm500-steel-sku-806179" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birchwood-casey-66-ipsc-silhouette-target-1-2-nm500-steel-sku-806179/public"/></a></div>

Its construction lends itself to withstanding a variety of centerfire calibers, providing a rewarding experience each time I hit the mark.

However, there's always room for improvement. The 1/2" steel thickness may not suit some users who prefer a more lightweight target. Additionally, the product did not come with the required carriage bolts, which resulted in an extra purchase.

Overall, the Birchwood Casey 1/2" Steel Target offers quality material and a satisfying sound when struck solidly with a round. If you're in the market for a reliable and versatile steel target, this one is worth considering.

## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steel+Rifle+Targets-5/public" alt="Steel Rifle Targets-5"></a></div>

### What are steel rifle targets?

Steel rifle targets are robust, metal cutouts designed for shooting practice and training. They're typically engineered with holes or cutouts to show bullet impacts. They are used in various shooting activities, such as long-range practice, competition, or plinking.

### Why choose steel over paper targets?

Steel targets offer several advantages over paper ones. They are more durable, so they don't wear out as quickly. Besides, they provide instantaneous feedback (often in the form of a 'ping' sound) showing that you hit them, enhancing your training experience. Finally, they're environmentally friendly as they can be reused multiple times, reducing waste.

### How much do steel targets generally cost?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/steel-rifle-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steel+Rifle+Targets-6/public" alt="Steel Rifle Targets-6"></a></div>

Prices for steel targets vary based on size, complexity, and mounting options. Simple flat steel targets can cost anywhere between $20-$50, while more complex ones with multiple targets, swinger or gong systems, etc. , may cost $50-$200 or more.

### What is the recommended shooting distance for steel targets?

The recommended shooting distance depends on the size of the target and the caliber of your weapon. As a rule of thumb, shooting should be done from a distance that ensures all bullets remain within the backstop area of your target, thus limiting potential ricochet risks. For example, smaller targets are typically intended for closer shots, while larger ones can handle longer ranges.

### How long do steel rifle targets last?

Steel rifle targets are incredibly durable. Given they're made of resilient metal, they can withstand thousands of rounds, depending on the caliber you shoot, target position, and target angle. However, targets should be replaced if signs of damage or deterioration appear.

### What safety precautions should be taken when handling steel rifle targets?

Safety should always be top priority when shooting. Some important considerations include: \* Ensure the target is placed on a solid, safe backstop to prevent potential ricochet.

- Always wear proper eye and ear protection to protect against debris and loud noise.

- Maintain a safe distance from the target to minimize the risk of a 'close range, high-angle' shot. This could damage the target or, at very close range, the rifle itself.

- Always identify and respect shooting lanes other people are using.

### How should steel targets be maintained and cleaned?

Regular maintenance and cleaning will prolong the lifespan of your steel rifle targets. To clean them, start by wiping down the surface with a clean cloth. If there's rust or stubborn stains, use a wire brush or sandpaper to remove them. Apply a thin layer of protective coat such as mineral oil, wax, or silicone spray to help safeguard against future rust and corrosion.
