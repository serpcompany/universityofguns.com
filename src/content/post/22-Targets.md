### [Automatic .22 Caliber Prairie Popper Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Do All Outdoors. 22 Prairie Popper Target in my backyard shooting range for a while now, and it is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining and rewarding targets I've come across. The lifelike representation of a prairie dog silhouette adds to its appeal, as does its popping action which never ceases to amaze.

The target is constructed from high-quality steel, making it incredibly durable and long-lasting even with prolonged use. The robust springs built into the base deliver an impressive recoil every time the target is hit, enhancing overall engagement. Despite being rated for. 22 caliber firearms only, I've found that it can handle various ammunition types without any issues; though you might need to touch up the paint job occasionally due to hotter loads leaving more marks on the target plate.

One minor issue I faced was mounting it on softer ground but this can be easily resolved with some creativity (such as setting it up on wooden boards). Additionally, these targets can perform well at greater distances than advertised - just note that they might show minor dents instead of popping back up when struck by higher velocity projectiles (like if you try them out with an airgun or. 177 pellets).

In summary, this product has provided countless hours of enjoyment in my backyard range and is definitely worth its price!

### [Premium M16A1 Slow Fire Qualification Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-targets-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-targets-101/public"/></a></div>

When I first laid my hands on the Rite in the Rain 25 Meter Targets, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But boy, was I in for a treat! As a shooting enthusiast, these targets have truly been a game-changer for me.

Another standout aspect of these targets is the permanent ink imprint that won't wash or rub off. This ensures that your target stays in perfect condition, even if you're caught in a sudden downpour at the range. Additionally, the sheets separate easily even when wet, making it a breeze to set up and take down your practice area.

However, there's one minor drawback to these targets that I've noticed. While the ink does hold up well in wet conditions, it can sometimes smear if you're not careful when marking your shots. But honestly, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the overall quality and performance of these targets.

All in all, the Rite in the Rain 25 Meter Targets are an exceptional product that has greatly improved my accuracy and overall shooting skills. If you're in the market for some high-quality targets that can withstand any weather conditions, then look no further than these!
