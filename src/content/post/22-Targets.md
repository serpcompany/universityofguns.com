### [Automatic .22 Caliber Prairie Popper Steel Target](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/do-all-outdoors-22pp-22-prairie-popper-steel-target-1/public"/></a></div>

I have been using the Do All Outdoors. 22 Prairie Popper Target in my backyard shooting range for a while now, and it is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining and rewarding targets I've come across. The lifelike representation of a prairie dog silhouette adds to its appeal, as does its popping action which never ceases to amaze.

The target is constructed from high-quality steel, making it incredibly durable and long-lasting even with prolonged use. The robust springs built into the base deliver an impressive recoil every time the target is hit, enhancing overall engagement. Despite being rated for. 22 caliber firearms only, I've found that it can handle various ammunition types without any issues; though you might need to touch up the paint job occasionally due to hotter loads leaving more marks on the target plate.

One minor issue I faced was mounting it on softer ground but this can be easily resolved with some creativity (such as setting it up on wooden boards). Additionally, these targets can perform well at greater distances than advertised - just note that they might show minor dents instead of popping back up when struck by higher velocity projectiles (like if you try them out with an airgun or. 177 pellets).

In summary, this product has provided countless hours of enjoyment in my backyard range and is definitely worth its price!

I recently got the chance to try out the Do-All Outdoors. 22 Auto Reset Target, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my shooting practice sessions. The weather-resistant paint means I don't have to worry about it getting damaged in the elements, and the easy reset feature means I can keep firing without constantly having to stop and reset the targets myself.

It's incredibly durable, too. I've been using it almost daily for the past month, and it's still standing strong with no signs of damage or wear. Plus, the fact that it's been tested specifically for. 22 caliber pistol or rifle shooters means I can trust that it's going to perform exactly as it should.

The long life is definitely a plus. I love that I can keep reusing the targets for hours of fun, and the overall construction is impressive.

### [Premium M16A1 Slow Fire Qualification Target Set](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-targets-101" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rite-in-the-rain-25-meter-targets-101/public"/></a></div>

When I first laid my hands on the Rite in the Rain 25 Meter Targets, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But boy, was I in for a treat! As a shooting enthusiast, these targets have truly been a game-changer for me.

First and foremost, these targets are specifically designed for the M16A1 platform, which means that they are perfectly sized and scaled to match the iron sights of this weapon system. The Course "C" Record Fire Qualification is printed on the front with an offset back, making it easy to track your progress and improve your skills over time.

One of the most impressive features of these targets is their durability. They're printed on heavy 32# Rite in the Rain card stock, which not only provides clean exit holes for evaluating shot placement but also ensures that they can withstand even the harshest range conditions. I've used these targets in both indoor and outdoor environments, and they've held up perfectly every time.

Another standout aspect of these targets is the permanent ink imprint that won't wash or rub off. This ensures that your target stays in perfect condition, even if you're caught in a sudden downpour at the range. Additionally, the sheets separate easily even when wet, making it a breeze to set up and take down your practice area.

However, there's one minor drawback to these targets that I've noticed. While the ink does hold up well in wet conditions, it can sometimes smear if you're not careful when marking your shots. But honestly, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the overall quality and performance of these targets.

All in all, the Rite in the Rain 25 Meter Targets are an exceptional product that has greatly improved my accuracy and overall shooting skills. If you're in the market for some high-quality targets that can withstand any weather conditions, then look no further than these!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="14-x-22-b-29-police-silhouette-target-50-red-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/14-x-22-b-29-police-silhouette-target-50-red-1/public"/></a></div>

However, one drawback I've noticed is that the paper used is quite light. While this makes it easy to see where you've missed, it can also tear easily if you're not careful.

### [22 Single Metal Spinner Target with Durable Build and Portable Design](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/22-targets?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

One thing I particularly appreciated was how quickly and easily I could set it up. Its lightweight design made it incredibly portable, so we could take it out whenever we felt like practicing. However, when using it for. 22 WMR or. 17 HRM, you might need to keep the distance at around 100 yards for the best results.

What truly stood out was the durability of the Champion spinner target. The quality steel spinner is built to withstand thousands of shots, making it a worthwhile investment for avid shooters like me.

On the downside, the orange dot on the target didn't last very long. But a quick fix was to simply spray paint it for a brighter appearance. All in all, the Champion. 22 Single Spinner Target has been an excellent addition to our shooting sessions, bringing both fun and excitement to the table.
