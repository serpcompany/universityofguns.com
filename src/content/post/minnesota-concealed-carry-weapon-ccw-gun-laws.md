Minnesota: Gun Laws Summary
---------------------------


Minnesota operates on a shall-issue policy for permits to carry, meaning that permits will be granted unless there is a substantial likelihood that the applicant would be a danger to themselves or others if authorized to carry a handgun ([Minn. Stat. § 624.714](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/624.714)). Permits are issued by the Sheriff's office in the applicant's county of residence, and both residents and non-residents can apply. As of March 31, 2023, a person no longer has to be at least 21 years old to obtain a permit to carry a handgun in public, as this requirement was found to violate the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ([MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/31/federal-court-rules-against-minnesotas-age-limit-for-gun-permits)).


There is no permit, background check, or firearm registration required when purchasing a handgun from a private individual in Minnesota.


Both open carry and concealed carry are legal in Minnesota with a Permit to Carry a Pistol (PCP) or a permit from a state that Minnesota honors, and there is no stipulation in the law regarding whether the weapon must be concealed ([Minn. Stat. § 624.714](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/624.714)). Permits are not required for transporting a firearm, keeping it at home, or keeping it in a place of business. Minnesota will honor permits from states with similar permit requirements ([Minn. Stat. § 624.714](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/624.714)).


### Justifiable Taking of Life


The intentional taking of another person's life is legal in Minnesota only if necessary in resisting or preventing an offense that the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another person to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode ([Minn. Stat. § 609.06](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.06); [609.065](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.065)).


#### Self-Defense


Minnesota law imposes a duty to retreat, meaning that a person may only use deadly force as a last resort if they feel threatened. Although Minnesota doesn't have a Castle Doctrine law per se, it does recognize the principles of the doctrine because Minnesota law allows a person to use deadly force if they reasonably believe that they or another person is at risk of great bodily harm or death, or to prevent a felony from occurring in the person's home ([Minn. Stat. § 609.065](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.065)).


#### Authorized Use of Force


Reasonable force may be used in Minnesota when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist:


* When used by any person in resisting or aiding another to resist an offense against the person;
* When used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property, in resisting a trespass upon or other unlawful interference with such property;
* When used by a parent, guardian, teacher, or other lawful custodian of a child or pupil, in the exercise of lawful authority, to restrain or correct such child or pupil;
* When used by a school employee or school bus driver, in the exercise of lawful authority, to restrain a child or pupil, or to prevent bodily harm or death to another; or
* When used by a common carrier in expelling a passenger who refuses to obey a lawful requirement for the conduct of passengers and reasonable care is exercised with regard to the passenger's personal safety ([Minn. Stat. § 609.06](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.06)).
