## Reviews

### [IWB Kydex Holster for Smith & Wesson M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/we-the-people-holsters-constitution-right-hand-iwb-holster-compatible-with-smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently purchased this Kydex holster for my concealed carry needs and have been using it daily. One of the standout features of this holster is its precise fit for my specific gun model, providing me with an audible click when I securely holster my gun, giving me peace of mind that it's held in place safely.

The quality of the Kydex material is impressive, as it is durable, waterproof, and lightweight. I also appreciate the adjustable retention feature which allows me to customize the holster according to my preferences. The fully adjustable design makes it easy to change the carry angle or position without having to purchase a new holster entirely.

However, there are a few areas where I believe this product could improve further. For example, when carrying appendix style with the optional claw attachment, printing can still be an issue even after adjusting various settings on the claw itself. Additionally, although most reviews report solid construction some customers have experienced minor issues such as screws loosening over time so it's worth noting these potential drawbacks before making your purchase decision!

Overall this Kydex Holster from Odin offers good value for money considering its lifetime guarantee against defects along with other great features like being waterproof and offering a precise fit for your specific gun model.

### [Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wilson-92g-brigadier-tactical-owb-holster-right-handed-wilson-combat-blade-tech-1/public"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Blade-Tech Classic OWB Holster for the Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical, and it has quickly become one of my favorites. The adjustable retention screws are a standout feature that I appreciate, as they allow me to fine-tune the fit of my firearm so it feels just right. Additionally, I love how IDPA and USPSA legal speed cut design makes this holster perfect for competition, while the positive lock trigger guard ensures that my firearm stays securely stored at all times.

The compatibility with optics is another great feature that makes this holster unique. It's also impressive to see that Blade Tech crafts these holsters with precision in the USA using high-strength Boltaron material, which speaks volumes about their durability and reliability. Plus, their lifetime guarantee gives me extra peace of mind when using this product out in the field.

However, there are a couple of things I wish could be improved upon: Firstly, having wider belt loop options would make this holster more versatile in terms of carry set up. Secondly, some users have reported issues with adjusting screws getting stuck or not fitting properly when switching out attachments - something that could potentially be improved upon by Blade Tech in future iterations of their product lineup! But overall these drawbacks are minor compared to all the awesome features packed into this exceptional holster; definitely worth considering if you're serious about competitive shooting or simply want an excellent OWB option for everyday carry!

Additionally, the compatibility with a wide range of belt attachments added versatility to this holster.

However, there were a few initial adjustments needed regarding fitment and retention strength adjustment which were easily rectified by simply loosening or tightening screws.

The full length sweat guard is another notable addition, which not only prevents discomfort from sweat but also ensures that no sharp edges on the firearm dig into your skin. I found this feature especially useful during extended periods of wear. Furthermore, the holster boasts a positive lock trigger guard that provides a tactile feedback - adding an extra layer of security and peace of mind knowing my firearm stays secure at all times.

The fit on my S&W Shield 9/40/Plus is great, allowing for smooth draws while offering adjustable retention to tailor to personal preferences.

### [Slim IWB Kydex Holster for S&W M&P Shield](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/white-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hols-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smith-wesson-mp-shield-m2-0-plus-9mm-40-30-super-carry-iwb-left-handed-holster-by-we-the-people-hols-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this IWB holster for my Smith & Wesson M&P Shield / Plus 9mm/. 40/30 Super Carry for a few weeks now, and I must say it's a great addition to my concealed carry setup.

The adjustable retention pressure ensures that my weapon stays securely in place without feeling too tight or loose.

The highlights of this product are its compact size and custom fit for the Smith & Wesson M&P Shield / Plus 9mm/. 40/30 Super Carry series. It is made in the USA with high-quality materials that guarantee durability, making it a great investment considering its affordable price point.

One thing I noticed was that the holster comes with a pre-drilled hole for an optic cut-out, which may not be useful for everyone since not all carry setups include red dots or optics. However, being able to adjust the carry angle and retention pressure makes up for it by providing a personalized fit. I've also found that wearing pants with a slightly stiffer belt helps keep the holster in place better when carrying appendix style or strong side carry at 3 or 4 o'clock position.

While there may be some minor issues, they are easily remedied by adjusting the holster's settings or choosing appropriate clothing options for carrying purposes. As someone who values both protection and discretion when carrying my firearm daily, I would definitely recommend giving this holster a try if you own one of these specific firearms models from Smith & Wesson M&P Shield / Plus 9mm/. 40/30 Super Carry series.

### How do I choose the right size white gun holster for my firearm?

When selecting a white gun holster, it is essential to choose one that fits your specific firearm model. Most manufacturers provide size guides and compatibility lists for their holsters, so be sure to check those before making a purchase.
