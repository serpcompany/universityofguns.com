Idaho: Gun Laws Summary
-----------------------


Idaho Gun Laws
--------------


Idaho is a shall-issue state for concealed carry. This means that county sheriffs issue concealed weapon licenses locally. If you are over 18 and legally allowed to possess a firearm, you can carry a concealed firearm without a license. 


You do not need a license to purchase a firearm from a private individual in Idaho. There is also no waiting period, background check, or firearms registration required. But if you purchase a handgun from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), you will need to undergo a background check. 


Permitless concealed carry became legal in Idaho in March 2020. This means that any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who can legally possess a firearm or a current member of the armed forces of the United States can carry a concealed firearm for self-defense without a license. 


Open carry is legal for anyone over 18 who can legally possess a firearm without a license in Idaho. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary schools and courthouses. 


### Concealed Carry Licenses


Idaho offers two types of Concealed Weapons Licenses (CWL). Both require the applicant to be at least 18 years old. A CWL covers concealed weapons including any dirk, dirk knife, bowie knife, dagger, pistol, revolver, or any other deadly or dangerous weapon. An Enhanced CWL is available for purposes of reciprocity for those who wish to travel out of state. 


Idaho issues CWLs to residents and non-residents. Concealed carry licenses require a firearms training course that has been state-approved or experience with a firearm through participation in an organized shooting competition or military service. Some states will only accept the enhanced version of Idaho's license.


### Self-Defense Laws in Idaho


Idaho is a Castle Doctrine state and has a "stand your ground" law. A law-abiding citizen may stand his or her ground and protect himself or herself or a third party anywhere he or she has a legal right to be. 


#### Defense of Self and Others


No person in this state shall be placed in legal jeopardy of any kind whatsoever for protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary, or when coming to the aid of another whom they reasonably believe to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime. A person confronted with such danger has a clear right to act upon appearances such as would influence the action of a reasonable person. 


#### Defense of Place


A person using force or deadly force in defense of a habitation, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle is presumed to have acted reasonably and had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the force is used against a person whose entry or attempted entry is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously or by stealth, or for the purpose of committing a felony.


#### Liability


A person is released from liability when protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary or when coming to the aid of another whom they reasonably believe to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime.


The term "habitation" means any building, inhabitable structure, or conveyance of any kind, whether the building, inhabitable structure, or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile including a tent. It is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night, including a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest, and includes the curtilage of any such dwelling. 


The term "place of business or employment" means a commercial enterprise or establishment owned by a person as all or part of the person’s livelihood or is under the owner’s control or under the control of an employee or agent of the owner with responsibility for protecting persons and property and shall include the interior and exterior premises of the place of business or employment. 


The term "vehicle" means any motorized vehicle that is self-propelled and designed for use on public highways to transport people or property.
