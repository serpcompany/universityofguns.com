The IDPA and USPSA legal optic ready speed cut design allows for efficient draws and target acquisition in competition, making it stand out from other holsters on the market. While I did come across one minor issue with attaching some accessories due to smaller holes in comparison with Tek-Lok attachment, this could be easily remedied by providing different sized screw options or enlarging those holes slightly.

Its modular mounting holes and adjustable retention screws offer customizability while ensuring your firearm remains secure throughout the day - all backed by a lifetime guarantee.
