### [Rothco Concealed Carry Soft Shell Jacket with Holsters](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="rothco-concealed-carry-soft-shell-black-jacket-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rothco-concealed-carry-soft-shell-black-jacket-1/public"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Rothco Soft Shell Black Jacket for weeks now, I can attest to its usefulness and concealed carry capabilities. The dual padded concealed carrying pockets allow for easy access to your firearm, with the adjustable hook and loop elastic wrist cuffs helping maintain a seamless seal between your gloves and jacket. Adjustable drawstring waist provides a comfortable fit, while the removable drawstring hood adds a nice touch of versatility.

One of the standout features of this jacket is its interior concealed-carry pockets, catering to both right- and left-handed users. By positioning your weapon on your weak hand side for a smooth cross-draw and storing magazines on your strong hand side, balance and concealability are achieved effectively. Further practicality comes in the form of twelve total pockets, including two front slash pockets and zippered upper arm and left forearm pockets.

Despite these great features, some minor cons are worth mentioning. The hood, while removable, can appear oversized, making it less functional and more about impressing others. Additionally, the vented underarms aimed at preventing overheating might not be as effective for some users.

In conclusion, the Rothco Soft Shell Black Jacket is a solid choice for those looking for a comfortable, concealed-carry-friendly piece of apparel. With a balance of practical features and some minor drawbacks, it could prove to be a reliable companion for daily use or tactical applications.

### [2-in-1" Conceal and Carry Leather Vest and Hoodie - Black](https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@universityofguns/amazon/jackets-with-gun-holsters?utm_source=universityofguns&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website"><img alt="hot-leathers-vsm1202-mens-black-2-in-1-conceal-and-carry-leather-vest-with-hoodie-black-2x-large-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hot-leathers-vsm1202-mens-black-2-in-1-conceal-and-carry-leather-vest-with-hoodie-black-2x-large-1/public"/></a></div>

I've been using this Hot Leathers Conceal and Carry Vest with a Hoodie for quite some time now, and I must say it's been a lifesaver - quite literally. The leather is incredibly comfortable and well-made. The dual front zippers combined with the hidden snap buttons make sure I stay protected from the wind, while the two chest pockets and hand pockets are perfect for holding my essentials.

On the one-piece back, I appreciated the seamless design that's ideal for club patches or embroidery work. Another standout feature is the color black hardware and the authentic YKK zippers, providing an essential touch to the overall ensemble. The concealed weapon and ammo pocket allow for discreet carrying, and the removable fleece hoodie is great for extra warmth.

However, there were some minor issues. The hoodie isn't suitable for heavy rain, and the patch access technology may not be the best choice for those new to sewing or customizing their vests. However, Hot Leathers' commitment to quality and durable materials makes this vest a must-have for any biker or outdoorsman who prioritizes both style and practicality.

I've had the pleasure of trying out the Wyoming Traders Men's Chisum Concealed Carry Canvas Jacket, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. The jacket is made with a thick, 12-ounce cotton canvas that provides excellent protection against the wind. Its classic western design, featuring a corduroy collar and Wyoming Traders logo buttons, gives it a rugged yet stylish appearance.

One of the best features of this jacket is its concealed carry holsters. They are ingeniously designed to hold various sizes of pistols securely while remaining accessible. Additionally, there are four magazine clip holders inside, making it incredibly convenient for those who carry multiple magazines.

The front of the jacket has ample pocket space, including two hand pockets at the waist and two chest pockets with button-down flaps. All of these pockets are lined with a polyester satin lining, which adds a comfortable touch.

I can confirm that this jacket is indeed lightweight and perfect for warmer weather. I've worn it during various outdoor activities, and it has performed admirably in every situation.

In terms of sizing, some reviewers mentioned that the jacket runs a bit small, so I would recommend trying it on before purchasing if possible.

As an avid outdoorsman, I recently found myself searching for a jacket that could withstand the toughest conditions while still maintaining a sense of style. That's when I came across the Cinch Concealed Carry Bonded Jacket, and let me tell you, it has completely changed my outdoor experience.

At first, I was skeptical about how well this jacket would perform in harsh weather. However, the textured polyester bonded material proved me wrong. It kept me warm and dry throughout a particularly harsh winter in the mountains. The western yokes and piping gave me that classic western look, while the snap cuffs provided a comfortable fit.

One feature that really stood out was the DWR finish, which kept water from seeping in and prevented stains from setting. And of course, the concealed carry pocket was an added bonus for those times when I needed to bring my concealed carry weapon along.

The only downside I encountered with this jacket was that it runs a bit large, so I ended up wearing a smaller size than usual.

All in all, the Cinch Concealed Carry Bonded Jacket has definitely become one of my go-to garments for any outdoor adventure. Its combination of fashion and function makes it a perfect choice for anyone looking to stay protected and stylish at the same time.

First and foremost, the classic military bomber style is a timeless look that never goes out of fashion. But Rothco has taken this design a step further by adding padded concealment pockets on both the left and right side of the jacket, complete with four mag pouches for secure and discreet carry. These pockets are not only spacious but also well-padded to ensure comfort and proper concealment.

Making this jacket even more versatile are the various pockets scattered throughout, including two inside slash pockets with snap closure, two front slash pockets with flap and snap closure, and a zippered utility pocket located on the left sleeve. Each of these pockets adds an extra layer of convenience, whether you're carrying a handgun or other valuable items like tech devices or important documents.

One aspect of this jacket that truly sets it apart from others on the market is its use of high-quality materials. The 100% nylon water repellent outer shell provides excellent protection against the elements, while the reversible rescue orange lining adds a pop of color and can be used as a signaling device in case of an emergency. Additionally, the poly fiberfill offers added warmth without weighing you down, making this jacket perfect for chilly days.
